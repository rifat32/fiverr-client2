The worldwide blockchain technology industry is anticipated to reach $1,432 billion by 2030, with a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 85.9% between 2022 and 2030, according to  [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-blockchain-technology-market).\n\nIt is clear that blockchain technology is here to stay, in light of the greatest blockchain trends of 2023, including the introduction of green initiatives, the growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the development of the Metaverse.\n\n## Security in the Blockchain Εnvironment\n\n**Security**  is critical because blockchain is a distributed, decentralized system that relies on immutability and trust to function. Because blockchain technology is based on trust and security, **any security breach might have catastrophic results**. In blockchain, security is essential for the following reasons:\n\n### Protection Against Unauthorized Access\n\nThe fact that blockchain is distributed means that anybody with network access may take part in the validation process. Due to this, it is crucial to guarantee that only authorized parties may access the network and modify the ledger.\n\n### Data Integrity\n\nData integrity is ensured by the immutability of blockchain, which means that once data is entered into the ledger, it cannot be changed or removed. Consensus mechanisms and other security measures, like cryptography, aid in ensuring the accuracy and immutability of the data uploaded to the blockchain.\n\n![Cyber Attacks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n### Protection Against Cyberattacks\n\nSmart contract flaws,  **51 per cent attacks**, and  [**sybil attacks**](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/what-are-sybil-attacks-on-the-blockchain)  are just a few of the cyberattacks that blockchain networks are susceptible to. Hashing algorithms, multi-signature authentication, and  **smart contract auditing**  are a few security techniques that can prevent such assaults and guarantee the safety of the blockchain network.\n\n### Double Spending Prevention\n\nWith every digital payment system, double spending poses a risk. Double-spending is avoided with the use of blockchain technology, which also employs consensus processes to guarantee accurate transaction execution.\n\n### Fraud Mitigation\n\nIdentity theft can be prevented, and safe digital identities can be created using blockchain technology. Fraud may be decreased and transaction authenticity assured by confirming and verifying IDs on the blockchain.\n\n## What is the Current State of Blockchain Security?\n\nBlockchain security is now in a mixed condition, with some advancements and persistent difficulties. Although blockchain is widely regarded as a safe technology, there have been a number of prominent instances of hacks and security lapses in recent years.\n\nFurthermore,  **security in blockchain is sometimes disputed**  due to the  **absence of a central authority**  to monitor and control the network. It may be difficult to rapidly and effectively detect and mitigate security concerns. Ultimately, despite advancements in blockchain security, the technology still poses a number of security threats and issues that require constant attention and investment in new security solutions.\n\n## Hacking Incidents in 2022\n\nA decentralized finance **(DeFi)**  platform called  **Poly Network**  was hacked in August 2022, causing the loss of nearly **$600 million**  in various cryptocurrencies. The majority of the cash that was taken was quickly returned by the hacker(s) who carried out the attack.\n\n**THORChain hack:** In July 2022, a decentralized exchange known as THORChain had a hack that cost over **$7 million**  in cryptocurrencies. A liquidity pool flaw in the network was blamed for the attack.\n\n**Binance:**  In March 2022, over **$40 million**  in various cryptocurrencies were stolen from Binance, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The exchange claimed to have located and frozen the cash that had been taken.\n\nDecentralized financial  **(DeFi)**  systems are becoming more and more popular, but they also pose serious security vulnerabilities, as shown by the hacks of the Poly Network and THORChain. DeFi technologies may become increasingly vulnerable to attack as more value is locked into them.\n\n![Cyber Security](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\n## Common Security Threats\n\n### Phishing and Malware Attacks\n\nBlockchain is not an exception to the prevalence of  **malware** and [**phishing**](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/22/2023-should-be-the-year-of-on-chain-user-security/)  **attacks**  in the digital world. These assaults may lead to the loss of private keys, which are needed to access blockchain wallets. Users should always be cautious while using connections that look suspicious. They should, of course, pay attention to the security that is necessary to protect their private keys.\n\n### Governance\n\nThe unpredictability of **blockchain governance**  systems creates a complicated environment when it comes to security.\n\nWithout clear governance, it might be difficult to make decisions regarding the network’s future and upkeep, which can lead to disagreements and potential  **security** problems.\n\n### Interconnectivity\n\nIn other words,  **blockchain interoperability**. It refers to the ability of different blockchains to communicate with one another and exchange data. It might be **difficult to monitor**  and  **verify transactions**  across different blockchains due to fragmentation brought on by a lack of interoperability, which, as a result, creates a security concern.\n\n### Double Spending Attacks\n\nAn attack that involves double spending occurs when a malevolent user attempts to utilize the same coin more than once. Because blockchain transactions are not always instantly validated and might take a while to be posted to the blockchain, this kind of attack is feasible.\n\n### 51% Attacks\n\nA 51 per cent attack, often referred to as a “**majority attack,”**  occurs when one entity has more than 50% of the computational power on a blockchain network. This enables the attacker to control the network and modify the blockchain. This ability gives the attacker the ability to  **undo transactions**,  **double-spend cryptos**, and  **stop the addition of new transactions**  to the blockchain.\n\n### Sybil Attacks\n\nAn online attack known as a  **sybil attack**  allows hackers to break into a network by taking over many machines or user accounts. Such attacks seek to seize control of a network in order to affect transactions and other network processes. These assaults often relate to a malevolent scammer running many nodes to take over a blockchain network in the Web3 environment.\n\nThe goal of the attacker is to significantly affect the network in order to engage in illicit actions while still abiding by the system’s core rules and regulations. Several IP address-based user accounts that, to an outsider looking in, appear to be distinct identities but are not can be created by a single machine or entity.\n\n### Smart Contract Immutability\n\nThe intransitive nature of  **smart contracts**  is one of the main problems that blockchains encounter. Immutability refers to the fact that once smart contracts are implemented on a blockchain, the protocol’s rules cannot be changed.\n\nThe fact that there is an opportunity for scammers to alter the contract details is the most disturbing factor. It is difficult to remedy a flaw discovered in the code since it is immutable. This limits the developers’ ability to provide solutions whenever an issue occurs.\n\nIn contrast to typical software defects, smart contracts can nonetheless have errors that are detrimental and have a significant impact. The Defi systems are now powered by smart contracts. This implies that a single flaw or vulnerability might result in significant losses for consumers.\n\n### Routing Attacks\n\nUnlike a 51 per cent attack, routing attacks focus on taking advantage of inherent flaws in the internet’s  **routing system**. A routing attack can be used by an attacker to divide a blockchain network into two different ones. As the attacker serves as a bridge between the two divisions, all network traffic passes through him. When the assault is eventually stopped, the blocks inside the smaller partition will all be deleted, forcing transactions to be dumped and repudiating any mining rewards. This forcibly builds parallel blockchains.\n\nSimilarly to this, routing attacks may also be employed to completely avoid detection while delaying the delivery of the mined block by at least 20 minutes on blockchain networks. This may lead to duplicate expenditures or mining power waste. Theoretically, these attacks are conceivable.\n\n### Consensus Protocol Attacks\n\nAnother form of vulnerability that might exist in blockchain technology is consensus protocol attacks. The methods that control how transactions are validated and added to the blockchain are known as “consensus protocols.”\n\n### Vulnerabilities in Blockchain User Endpoints\n\nSecurity in blockchain networks is subject to some gaps in user-interface devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones, just like any other online transaction service. An attacker attempting to gain access to your blockchain wallet may monitor your online activity around the clock or use malware to examine your files in search of the private key to your wallet.\n\nIt is crucial to keep your private key for your crypto wallet encrypted and avoid saving it as a plain text file. Also, installing safe antivirus software that guards against spyware is always advised.\n\n![Safety](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F3.png?alt=media)\n\n## Solutions For Blockchain Security\n\nThere are a number of **security solutions**  that can be integrated into blockchain technology in order to reduce the security issues mentioned above. Some of these remedies are:\n\n### Multi-Signature Authentication:\n\nBefore a transaction can be carried out, it needs to be approved by several parties. By doing so, fraud risk may be decreased and illegal access prevented.\n\n### Public and Private Key Cryptography\n\n**Security in blockchain** is ensured by **transactions**  that are protected by public and private key cryptography. To encrypt and decode transactions, each user has a public key and a private key. This makes sure that the funds can only be accessed by the specified recipient.\n\n### Auditing and Testing of Smart Contracts\n\n[Smart contract auditing](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/smart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide)  and testing can find weaknesses in smart contracts and make sure they work as intended.\n\n### Byzantine Fault Tolerance\n\nThis strategy allows a system to keep running even if some of its nodes malfunction or act maliciously. Attacks like Sybil attacks and 51% assaults may be avoided in this way.\n\n### Zero-Proof Knowledge\n\nIt is a cryptographic method that enables users to demonstrate their possession of certain information without divulging that information itself, making blockchain more secure and private.\n\n### Hashing Methods\n\nTo protect the integrity of transactions on the blockchain, hashing methods are utilized. Each transaction is given a distinct fingerprint, making it difficult to change the transaction without also altering the fingerprint.\n\n### Decentralized Exchanges\n\nUsers can trade cryptocurrencies on decentralized exchanges without depending on a centralized authority. Fraud and hacking risks can be decreased as a result of this methodology.\n\n![Web 3.0](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F4.png?alt=media)\n\n### Security in Blockchain this Year\n\nIn  **2023**, blockchain technology is expected to gain more popularity, and thus,  **security in blockchain is going to be a matter of high priority** for the organizations that are going to be adopting the Web 3.0 environment.\n\n**Increased Use of Decentralized Operations**\n\nWe may anticipate an increase in the number of companies and organizations using decentralized operations. As a result, stronger security measures will be required in order to safeguard the sensitive information and assets kept on these networks. The expansion of blockchain-based corporate operations is one of the top blockchain trends of 2023. More businesses are expected to take advantage of this technology because of the better security, transparency, and protection from cyberattacks that decentralized blockchains provide.\n\n### Interoperability\n\nAs blockchain networks continue to spread, it will become more and more crucial that they communicate with one another. Different blockchain networks will be able to connect with one another thanks to interoperability solutions, but these solutions will also bring forth new security issues that need to be resolved. Blockchain technology.\n\n### Secure Wallets\n\nMore software wallet integrations with various hardware wallets, also known as storage solutions, will also be seen, making it more difficult for thieves to access a victim’s money.\n\n### Quantum-Resistant Encryption\n\nAs quantum computing advances, it is possible that standard encryption techniques will be broken. Quantum-resistant encryption, which is built to fight against incoming attacks from quantum computers, has emerged as a result of this.\n\n### Zero-Knowledge Proofs\n\nAs data privacy concerns rise, blockchain developers are putting more effort into integrating privacy-focused features like zero-knowledge proofs and encryption to safeguard user data.\n\n### More Blockchain-Based Apps\n\nBlockchain software engineers will be in high demand in 2023. Blockchain technology will become increasingly necessary as more sophisticated ‘’Know Your Customer’’ [**(KYC)**](https://www.cyberscope.io/#kyc)  features, secure transactions, and other functions are developed.\n\n### MPC\n\nTechnology-based encryption will progress towards multi-party computation  **(MPC)**.  **Multi-factor authentication**, in which the user splits his key between a local wallet and a signature server, is one use of MPC. When a transaction has to be signed, those shards would cooperate, but they would also protect against a loss of cash if either were compromised, resulting in a much more safe and more secure cyber environment.\n\n### Account Abstraction\n\nIn 2023, there will be more discussion regarding ideas like “account abstraction.” Account abstraction, as well explained by Argent wallet creator and [Ethereum](https://www.cyberscope.io/ethereum-contract-audit)  cofounder  **Vitalik Buterin**, entails modifying Ethereum to basically make all addresses, not just smart contracts, programmable. This would allow cryptocurrency technology companies to investigate new solutions for securing wallets and improving the recovery of lost or stolen funds.\n\n### Blockchain Data Sharing\n\nIn 2023, user control over data ownership will be enabled via system designs for blockchain data sharing. Once they begin to “own” their data, users will be able to control who gets access to it. Healthcare, medical, and financial services will be the first to be impacted, but advertising and social media may also experience significant changes as a result of these new designs, suggests **Manjush Madabushi**, CTO and co-founder of Talentica Software.\n\n**Marijus Briedis**, CTO of NordVPN, said in 2022,  _“The next year will not be any easier when it comes to keeping users’ data safe and private. Authoritarian countries and hackers are working hard to compromise those factors. However, I see the light at the end of the tunnel because people are starting to value their data, pushing businesses and governments to take action’’_.\n\n![Trade and Value Chains](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F5.png?alt=media)\n\n### Trade and Value Chains\n\nTraceability is made possible throughout the whole supply chain via blockchain technology. Blockchains allow for instantaneous access to the status or legitimacy of a product since they record data in a digital, decentralized ledger. In addition to increasing efficiency and defensibility, this also establishes a worldwide value chain for commodities in a more secure context.\n\nThe blockchain ecosystem, which many firms have adopted, will continue, and it must continue to include **smart contracts**. 2023 will be a year characterized by  **efficient, safe, and precise international transactions**.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Security in**  **blockchain technology**  will change as it develops. It is crucial for companies and developers to emphasize security in their blockchain initiatives if they want to remain ahead of these dangers. This entails that businesses and developers must put security first by establishing strong security measures, keeping up with the most recent security trends and technology, and adhering to **cybersecurity**  laws and standards in order to overcome these security problems. To keep blockchain technology safe, dependable, and robust, this call to action is crucial.

When you receive an email like this, you are unable to identify who actually sent it or if the message is legitimate. The only thing that differentiates this from a genuine email is the fact that it’s likely to land in your spam folder instead of your inbox.\n\n## How to identify a spoofed email?\n\nThis makes spoofed emails hard to identify as they are usually treated just like any other normal email that you receive. But you guessed right — [Cyberscope](https://cyberscope.io/) has you covered! Here are a few key indicators that will help you spot a spoofed email:\n\n- **Check the email address,** **not just the display name.** For example, you might get an email that says it is from your bank urging you to change password as soon as possible. So the sender's name will be “US Bank of America.” If the email address is something like “customerservice@nowhere.com” chances are you’re being spoofed.\n- **Check the email Headers.** The email addresses in the header should match the email address it’s supposed to be coming from. You can check the whole header information using some [tools](https://mxtoolbox.com/Public/Tools/EmailHeaders.aspx?huid=8dac58f8-efc7-4757-ac81-9c7d722ebd59), this way you can see the path of the email before it got delivered to you.\n- **Check for syntax errors, urgent messages, or call to act on suspicious events.** It's very likely that the context of the mail will be some urgent message asking you to log in with your credentials on a third party (and most likely untrusted source) because your subscription is ending or your account will be hypothetically removed.\n\n![Protect your personal data](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fwhat-is-an-email-spoof-and-how-to-spot-one%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n## What to do if you spot a Phishing email?\n\nIf you got a phishing email or text message, report it. The information you give can help fight the scammers.\n\n**Step 1.** If you got a phishing **email**, forward it to the Anti-Phishing Working Group at your government.\n\nIf you got a phishing **text message**, forward it to SPAM.\n\n**Step 2.** Report the phishing attack to your government's related department.\n\n## What To Do if You Responded to a Phishing Email\n\nIf you think a scammer has your information, like your Social Security, credit card, or bank account number, go to your government's related website. There you’ll see the specific steps to take based on the information that you lost. If the scammer tried to gain access to your bank account, call your bank and notify them, and change your passwords just in case.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLiving in a modern world with information being accessible that easy provides great flexibility, but is also a reason to be extra careful as hackers and scammers have grasped this opportunity for their own profit.

Cryptocurrency scammers have stolen over $1 billion from more than 46,000 people since the start of 2021, a new Federal Trade Commission report says.\n\nCrypto scams have seen an unprecedented rise since 2018, shooting up to 60 times higher. One of the most common scams that people will encounter in this industry are rug pulls. In this guide, we’ll explore what rug pulls are and what are some signs to look for if you want to avoid becoming a victim of one.\n\n## What Is A Rug Pull?\n\nA rug pull happens when a fraudulent project team will create a new crypto token and then pull as much value out of them as possible before abandoning them as their price drops to zero. The project owner (or team) sometimes has the right to remove the liquidity of his token, rendering the tokens purchased by public investors worthless.\n\nRug pulls are a type of exit scam and one of the most common decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits.\n\n## Hard Rug Pulls vs Soft Rug Pulls\n\nRug pulls usually come in two different forms, hard and soft. A hard rug pull is when the development team behind the token will remove all liquidity from the project, sell their tokens and will usually disappear. Usually, when this happens it’s pretty difficult to recover your funds, but [not impossible](https://medium.com/@cyberscope/victim-of-a-crypto-scam-see-how-you-can-recover-your-funds-abcceb4cfe0b).\n\nA soft rug pull (or slow rug pull) is when the development team behind the project has abandoned their token, but keep reassuring the investors that they are still working on the project. Soft rug pulls usually bring less profits to scammers, but are very hard to make a case against them. This is because it’s not easy to prove whether the team has actually abandoned the project or not.\n\n![Hard Rug Pulls and Soft Rug Pulls](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fwhat-are-rug-pulls-and-how-you-can-avoid-getting-scammed%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n## How To Avoid a Rug Pull\n\nWhile you can never be 100% safe against rug pulls (especially soft/slow rug pulls), here are a few things to be aware of before investing in a new project:\n\n#### Locked Liquidity\n\nOne of the most common ways that investors become victims of rug pulls is when they are buying tokens where the liquidity pool is not locked. If there is no liquidity lock on the token supply in place, nothing stops the project owners from running off with the entirety of the liquidity. Make sure that the liquidity of the tokens you invest in is at least 90% locked to make sure your investment is not at risk of a hard rug pull.\n\n#### Locked Team Tokens\n\nAnother important thing to consider in your investments is the tokenomics of the project. How many tokens is the team of the token holding for themselves? Have they locked their tokens or have they put any kind of vesting schedule in place? Locking the team tokens means that the team will not be able to sell them (or part of them) until the end of the lock period. A good project team will not be looking to sell any of their tokens at least a few months after their cryptocurrency project has launched.\n\n#### KYC \u0026 Audit\n\nLast but not least, always check if the project team has their smart contract audited and if they have passed a KYC verification with a popular cyber security company like Cyberscope. [Smart contract audits](https://www.coinscope.co/blog/crypto-audit-firms) will uncover any potential vulnerabilities, but will not protect you against hard and soft rug pulls. KYC on the other hand will keep the project owners accountable in case they perform either a soft or a hard rug pull. In such cases, the KYC provider can use the project team's credentials and pursue legal action against them and potentially recover your funds.\n\n![KYC Certificate of Cyberscope](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fwhat-are-rug-pulls-and-how-you-can-avoid-getting-scammed%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nInvesting in crypto projects comes with a lot of potential risks (and also gains!).

Security vulnerabilities still exist, and one of the most significant issues with blockchain security is known as a Sybil Attack. In this guide, we’re going to cover everything you need to know about Sybil Attacks, including what they are, how they work, examples of them and how to prevent them from happening. So without any further ado, let’s jump straight in and learn more about Sybil Attacks!\n\n## **What Are Sybil Attacks?**\n\nA [Sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) is a type of attack in which an adversary creates multiple identities to gain control over a network. The term was first coined by psychologist Flora Rheta Schreiber in 1973, who used it to describe a woman (known as Sybil Dorsett) with dissociative identity disorder (DID).\n\nIn a blockchain context, the term refers to someone using multiple identities or accounts — known also as sockpuppets — to confuse and manipulate others. It’s possible for individuals or organizations with enough resources at their disposal to create large numbers of bogus accounts that make it appear there are more people involved in supporting a particular cause than actually exist. This can be used to sway public opinion and make fraudulent transactions seem legitimate.\n\n## **How Do Sybil Attacks Work**\n\nIn order to conduct a Sybil attack, an attacker must first create multiple identities. These new identities act independently from each other and have their own transactions on the blockchain network. In this way, it could appear as if there were many people using your service when in reality only one person was responsible for all their activities.\n\nAs you might imagine, there are many potential uses for such an attack:\n\n- Using bots to vote for someone else in elections. This has become a common problem with the rise of Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs).\n- Attackers may also be able to out-vote the honest nodes on a network if they create enough fake identities (or Sybil identities). They can then refuse to receive or transmit blocks, effectively blocking other users from a network.\n- In large-scale Sybil attacks, the attackers might even manage to take control of the network computing power or hash rate and carry out a [51% attack](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp). In such cases, they may be able to change the ordering of transactions and prevent them from being confirmed. They could even reverse transactions that they made while in control, which can lead to double-spending.\n\n![How Do Sybil Attacks Work](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fwhat-are-sybil-attacks-on-the-blockchain%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n## Examples of Sybil Attacks\n\nHere are a couple of real-life examples of Sybil attacks:\n\n- A notable Sybil attack was launched against the [Tor anonymity network](\u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)\u003e) for several months in 2014. Tor anonymity works by routing traffic through three separate nodes. The first knows the user’s IP address, and the third knows where the traffic is destined. The middle works as a sort of trusted intermediary so that nodes one and three have no knowledge of each other. Running huge numbers of servers has the potential to break those anonymity guarantees.\n- Another notable example was the 51% that happened to bitcoin gold which saw $18 million worth of bitcoin gold stolen in May 2018. That was the second time the network was hit with such an attack with the first one occurring in late 2017, resulting in over $72,000 worth of bitcoin gold tokens being double-spent.\n\n## **How To Prevent Sybil Attacks**\n\nOne way to prevent Sybil attacks is to rely more on proof-of-stake consensus algorithms rather than proof-of-work. Proof of stake consensus mechanism requires master node or service node operators to stake (lock up for a period of time) a significant amount of cryptocurrency. This stake acts as a deterrent to Sybil Attacks. A node detected by the network that is conducting fraudulent or malicious activity stands to lose a part of its stake, as well as the right to participate in the future. Since the stake is higher than the potential reward, the cost to attack again exceeds the reward.\n\nFurthermore, to take control of the entire network the attacker would need to acquire 51% of the circulating supply of the cryptocurrency. The cost to do this would be so high that it is extremely unlikely any attacker could afford it.\n\nLarge proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin are also impossible to be victims of 51% attacks. The amount of mining hardware needed to control 51% of the network’s hash power (enabling a Sybil Attack) would be exorbitantly expensive, so much so that it would not be worth the attacker’s while. Put simply, the cost to attack would exceed the potential rewards.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe’ve covered the basics of Sybil attacks and how they work. These attacks are an example of how malicious users can manipulate a blockchain to their advantage.

FBI’s [Internet Crime Complaint Centre](https://www.ic3.gov/) records over twice as many incidents of phishing than any other type of computer crime. Of course, with the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies, we are seeing more and more phishing attacks in the crypto industry as well.\n\nTo help you stay safe from phishing scams, we’ve put together this guide to what phishing is and how you can protect yourself against these dangerous cyberattacks.\n\n## What Is Phishing?\n\n![Phishing Attack Concept](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fwhat-is-phishing-in-crypto-and-how-you-can-avoid-it%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\nPhishing is a type of email scam where hackers will send out fake emails that appear to be legitimate messages sent by companies or organizations that you know. These emails usually contain attachments that contain malicious software (malware), links to malicious websites, or requests for personal information such as usernames and passwords.\n\nPhishing attacks aren’t limited to just email — they can also take place on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter and messaging apps like WhatsApp or Telegram. For example, cryptocurrency scammers have been known to send out fake messages on Telegram or WhatsApp claiming that users have won free bitcoin or another cryptocurrency token — but all they have to do is click on an attachment in order for them to claim their “won” tokens.\n\n## How You Can Protect Yourself Against Phishing Attacks\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against phishing attacks is by being careful about what you click on and where you go online.\n\nHere are some tips:\n\n- Don’t open emails from people you don’t know personally or professionally; if possible, don’t open any unsolicited emails at all\n- Be suspicious of any emails that ask for personal information or advice on how to proceed with an order; legitimate businesses will not ask for this kind of information via email\n- Use caution when visiting websites that look like popular retailers’ sites (such as Amazon), but are not actually those companies’ sites; if in doubt, check the address bar at the top of your browser window to make sure you are on the actual site you wanted to visit. For example, a scammer might have created a replica site of Amazon and instead of amazon.com, it might be named amaz0n.com.\n- If you visit a crypto website NEVER enter your seed phrase to “connect your wallet”. Web3 integrations will not ask for your seed phrase only to connect your wallet.\n- If you get a private message on your Telegram account always double-check the username of the sender. Crypto scammers are known to replicate the name and avatar of your connections and will find an excuse to ask you for money.\n- Never trust private messages from “admins” of groups you follow. Admins will never DM users to help them or ask for their seed phrase.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe first step to protecting yourself against phishing is recognizing that phishing attacks exist. Second, be assured that a legitimate company will not ask for personal information from its customers (i.e. seed phrases, passwords, credit card numbers, and so on). Remember: if you receive a private message or email that appears to be legitimate, but is asking you to “update” or give away your personal information such as seed phrase or password do not answer it! A genuine company will never ask for such information.\n\nAt [Cyberscope](https://www.cyberscope.io/), it’s our mission to protect retail investors and traders from scammers and fraudsters, so if you ever are in doubt about someone trying to scam you, feel free to send us a message!\n","author":"Cyberscope Team","title":"What Is Phishing In Crypto And How You Can Avoid It","description":"To help you stay safe from phishing scams, we’ve put together this guide to what phishing is and how you can protect yourself against these dangerous cyberattacks.","cover":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fwhat-is-phishing-in-crypto-and-how-you-can-avoid-it%2Fcover.png?alt=media","created":"2022-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","category":"Security","domains":[]},{"id":"what-is-a-honeypot","content":"\nHoneypots have disturbed a lot of users while trying to invest in new tokens.

That's why sometimes it's hard to identify one before you invest your money. Some people will prefer to wait until they see some sales, or buy a small amount first and then try to sell it. That's still not the best practice as some malicious projects can be converted into honeypot after a specific time or on bigger amounts.\n\n## **How to spot a honeypot**\n\nThe best way to protect against a honeypot is to ask for a smart contract audit and read it carefully looking for any prevent trading findings.\n\n![Cyberscope Audit Sample](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fwhat-is-a-honeypot%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\nIn Cyberscope [**audit reports**](https://www.coinscope.co/audit) we present the Honeypot Danger in a _Stop Transactions_ finding, explaining the user will never be able to sell again.\n\nAnother factor that can help with spotting a honeypot is checking if the project has [KYC](https://www.cyberscope.io/#kyc).

To achieve that we are providing services like KYC that can protect your investment in the case you become the victim of a crypto scam.\n\n## What to check before investing\n\nBefore investing your funds in any new project it is important to DYOR (Do Your Own Research). You will hear this acronym a lot in the crypto industry, but it is critical to understand its importance.\n\n\u003e \"New crypto users should do their own research and trust themselves.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e - CZ, Binance CEO\n\n![Cyberscope offers the highest quality KYC service.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fvictim-of-a-crypto-scam-see-how-you-can-recover-your-funds%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\nCyberscope offers the highest quality KYC service.\n\nAlways, invest in projects that have been audited \u0026 KYC’d by a reputable firm like Cyberscope. This will give you higher chances to recover your funds in case the project owners of the cryptocurrency you invested in, decide to commit some sort of fraud.\n\n## How to identify if you have been scammed\n\nNo matter how careful you are, there are still possibilities that your hard-earned funds end up in the pockets of scammers. The first thing you ought to do is make sure you’ve actually fallen a victim to a crime.\n\nHere are the first things you need to check before taking action to report a case of fraud:\n\n1.  **Are the founders of the project responsive on social media?**  \n    Check the project’s Telegram channel or Discord to see what other investors like yourself are saying. It is possible that you missed an announcement or a migration is happening in the contract and trades are paused.\n\n2.  **Trace the transactions of the team’s wallets.**  \n    Look at how the funds of the projects are being managed by the team. Do the transactions match what the founders are claiming? Do you notice any suspicious patterns?\n\n3.  **Look at the project’s roadmap.**  \n    Is the project doing active development on the project? Are they continuing their marketing activities?\n\nOnce you are certain that you are a victim of a crime, gather all the evidence you can and contact the KYC provider of the project to open an investigation.\n\n## How you can recover your funds\n\nSo, you spent hours researching a new project and still the unexpected happens and the project you invested in, either rugpulls or the project owners perform some other sort of scam. What can you do now?\n\n![How you can recover your funds](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fvictim-of-a-crypto-scam-see-how-you-can-recover-your-funds%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to contact the KYC provider of the project. KYC companies like Cyberscope will open a thorough investigation on your behalf and do their best to recover your funds.\n\nOnce it has been determined that the project has committed a crime, a respected KYC provider will file charges on your behalf. That shouldn’t stop you to pursue the scammers yourself as well to increase your chances of recovering your funds.\n\nHere are the steps you can take to make this happen:\n\n1.  **Request an incident report from your KYC provider.**  \n    The incident report will contain information like the owner's wallet and the owner’s personal data, so you can file charges with your local authorities.\n\n2.  **Gather a list of all the blockchain transactions involved in the process**  \n    This will prove to be valuable evidence for authorities to help them conduct their own research and investigation. If you see the scammer withdrawing their funds to a Centralised Exchange like Binance, immediately [contact the exchange](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360000006051) with all the information.\n\n3.  **File a report with FTC \u0026 FCA**  \n    There are organisations like the [Federal Trade Commission](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-cryptocurrency-scams) and the [Financial Conduct Authority](https://www.fca.org.uk/) that have dedicated departments to battling cryptocurrency frauds.\n\n4.  **Hire a Cryptohunter**  \n    If you have lost a substantial amount, you might want to consider hiring an expert to help you out. Cryptohunters work with both cryptocurrency holders and law enforcement agencies to search for and recover misplaced, inaccessible or stolen cryptocurrencies. They use specialized software to generate millions of potential passwords and tend to charge a flat fee.\n\nRecovering your crypto funds if you have been a victim of crime, might be difficult but not impossible. A lot of users have reported successful cases, where they managed to recover a part or the full amount of funds they lost by following these steps. Don’t give up and remember to always DYOR before investing in new projects.\n","author":"Cyberscope Team","title":"Victim of a Crypto Scam?

Self-executing code blocks known as smart contracts are kept on a blockchain network. They are used to safeguard and automate a variety of activities, such as voting systems, asset transfers and payments.\n\nUnfortunately, smart contracts are not impervious to flaws and attacks, which can result in monetary losses and reputational damage. As a result, safeguarding smart contract security is essential for the development of blockchain-based applications. By examining the code for flaws, evaluating its robustness, and offering suggestions for changes, smart contract security tools are essential in identifying and preventing potential security issues. This blog post compiles the top ten smart contract security tools that are commonly used by developers and auditors to verify the security of their smart contracts.\n\n![Cyberscan](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fthe-top-10-smart-contract-security-tools%2F1.png?alt=media  )\n\n## Cyberscan\n\nOne of Cyberscope’s most beneficial products for aiding investors in making informed decisions is the Cyberscan Contract Address scan tool. Investors are frequently drawn to fresh ventures and this tool is specifically focused on smart contracts ensuring that they are secure.\n\nCyberscan offers all the relevant metrics in a single source of truth, eliminating the need for several checks and searches across various sources.\n\n**[Cyberscan](https://www.cyberscope.io/cyberscan)** is effortless. Simply paste the contract address into the related field, choose your network from the dropdown menu, and press the search button. A comprehensive report from the smart contract analysis is provided by the program, together with important indications like contract ownership, contract proxies, Audit and KYC attachments, and the code resemblance to well-known forks.\n\nFuture updates to the Cyberscan tool will include tracking liquidity, token lockers, and holder distribution.\n\n![Safescan](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fthe-top-10-smart-contract-security-tools%2F2.png?alt=media  )\n\n## Safescan\n\nThe concern for privacy in anonymous team projects in the cryptocurrency world has increased in recent years. Unfortunately, this trend has led to risky behaviour by individuals who hide behind anonymity. To address this issue, Cyberscope offers a solution that holds project teams accountable through a rigorous vetting process prioritizing transparency, accountability, and trust.\n\nIn the fight against Web3 criminal activity, **[Safescan](https://www.cyberscope.io/cyberscan)** provides a valuable product to reduce such activities.

This tool is particularly useful for investors who want to check if the project they have invested in is unique or if it has been copied.\n\nSimilarity Scan normally determines how similar two source codes are by looking for characters or phrases from one contract in the other. Token comparison and commonality detection are steps in this process. This process involves comparing the tokens, which are the basic building blocks of code, and identifying the common ones.\n\nCyberscope’s [Similarityscan](https://www.cyberscope.io/similarityscan) tool can perform a side-by-side comparison of source codes. The tool checks for similarities by comparing the code that is being checked to the existing codes in its database. This is a crucial factor in ensuring the security and reliability of a smart contract.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that a smart contract still has to be extensively inspected to verify its security, even if it is very close to a reliable implementation.\n\n![Signaturescan](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fthe-top-10-smart-contract-security-tools%2F4.png?alt=media  )\n\n## Signaturescan\n\nCyberscope provides a potent application called **[Signaturescan](https://www.cyberscope.io/signaturescan)** that aids users in spotting suspicious activities.

It provides a transparent and safe method for storing and transferring data. Despite the great degree of safety that blockchain technology offers, it is nonetheless open to different threats and assaults.\n\nA series of transactions are contained in each block of the chain, which are then added to the chain in chronological order after being confirmed by the network. A block cannot be changed or removed after it has been added to the chain. Although it is frequently connected to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it can offer a wide range of potential applications beyond finance, including supply chain management, identity verification, and voting systems.\n\n**Security in blockchain**  is a crucial aspect. Various security measures are implemented to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data.  **Decentralization**,  **immutability**,  **transparency**, and  **security**  are some of the main characteristics of blockchain technology.\n\n## Blockchain Benefits\n\nThe benefits of blockchain are what make it a crucial component of the upcoming technological revolution. Beyond cryptocurrencies, many different industries are now affected by them. They include, among others, the healthcare industry, e-commerce, publishing, and the financial sector. The worldwide blockchain technology industry is anticipated to reach $1,432 billion by 2030, with a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 85.9% between 2022 and 2030, according to  [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-blockchain-technology-market).\n\nIt is clear that blockchain technology is here to stay, in light of the greatest blockchain trends of 2023, including the introduction of green initiatives, the growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the development of the Metaverse.\n\n## Security in the Blockchain Εnvironment\n\n**Security**  is critical because blockchain is a distributed, decentralized system that relies on immutability and trust to function. Because blockchain technology is based on trust and security, **any security breach might have catastrophic results**. In blockchain, security is essential for the following reasons:\n\n### Protection Against Unauthorized Access\n\nThe fact that blockchain is distributed means that anybody with network access may take part in the validation process. Due to this, it is crucial to guarantee that only authorized parties may access the network and modify the ledger.\n\n### Data Integrity\n\nData integrity is ensured by the immutability of blockchain, which means that once data is entered into the ledger, it cannot be changed or removed. Consensus mechanisms and other security measures, like cryptography, aid in ensuring the accuracy and immutability of the data uploaded to the blockchain.\n\n![Cyber Attacks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n### Protection Against Cyberattacks\n\nSmart contract flaws,  **51 per cent attacks**, and  [**sybil attacks**](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/what-are-sybil-attacks-on-the-blockchain)  are just a few of the cyberattacks that blockchain networks are susceptible to. Hashing algorithms, multi-signature authentication, and  **smart contract auditing**  are a few security techniques that can prevent such assaults and guarantee the safety of the blockchain network.\n\n### Double Spending Prevention\n\nWith every digital payment system, double spending poses a risk. Double-spending is avoided with the use of blockchain technology, which also employs consensus processes to guarantee accurate transaction execution.\n\n### Fraud Mitigation\n\nIdentity theft can be prevented, and safe digital identities can be created using blockchain technology. Fraud may be decreased and transaction authenticity assured by confirming and verifying IDs on the blockchain.\n\n## What is the Current State of Blockchain Security?\n\nBlockchain security is now in a mixed condition, with some advancements and persistent difficulties. Although blockchain is widely regarded as a safe technology, there have been a number of prominent instances of hacks and security lapses in recent years.\n\nFurthermore,  **security in blockchain is sometimes disputed**  due to the  **absence of a central authority**  to monitor and control the network. It may be difficult to rapidly and effectively detect and mitigate security concerns. Ultimately, despite advancements in blockchain security, the technology still poses a number of security threats and issues that require constant attention and investment in new security solutions.\n\n## Hacking Incidents in 2022\n\nA decentralized finance **(DeFi)**  platform called  **Poly Network**  was hacked in August 2022, causing the loss of nearly **$600 million**  in various cryptocurrencies. The majority of the cash that was taken was quickly returned by the hacker(s) who carried out the attack.\n\n**THORChain hack:** In July 2022, a decentralized exchange known as THORChain had a hack that cost over **$7 million**  in cryptocurrencies. A liquidity pool flaw in the network was blamed for the attack.\n\n**Binance:**  In March 2022, over **$40 million**  in various cryptocurrencies were stolen from Binance, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The exchange claimed to have located and frozen the cash that had been taken.\n\nDecentralized financial  **(DeFi)**  systems are becoming more and more popular, but they also pose serious security vulnerabilities, as shown by the hacks of the Poly Network and THORChain. DeFi technologies may become increasingly vulnerable to attack as more value is locked into them.\n\n![Cyber Security](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\n## Common Security Threats\n\n### Phishing and Malware Attacks\n\nBlockchain is not an exception to the prevalence of  **malware** and [**phishing**](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/22/2023-should-be-the-year-of-on-chain-user-security/)  **attacks**  in the digital world. These assaults may lead to the loss of private keys, which are needed to access blockchain wallets. Users should always be cautious while using connections that look suspicious. They should, of course, pay attention to the security that is necessary to protect their private keys.\n\n### Governance\n\nThe unpredictability of **blockchain governance**  systems creates a complicated environment when it comes to security.\n\nWithout clear governance, it might be difficult to make decisions regarding the network’s future and upkeep, which can lead to disagreements and potential  **security** problems.\n\n### Interconnectivity\n\nIn other words,  **blockchain interoperability**. It refers to the ability of different blockchains to communicate with one another and exchange data. It might be **difficult to monitor**  and  **verify transactions**  across different blockchains due to fragmentation brought on by a lack of interoperability, which, as a result, creates a security concern.\n\n### Double Spending Attacks\n\nAn attack that involves double spending occurs when a malevolent user attempts to utilize the same coin more than once. Because blockchain transactions are not always instantly validated and might take a while to be posted to the blockchain, this kind of attack is feasible.\n\n### 51% Attacks\n\nA 51 per cent attack, often referred to as a “**majority attack,”**  occurs when one entity has more than 50% of the computational power on a blockchain network. This enables the attacker to control the network and modify the blockchain. This ability gives the attacker the ability to  **undo transactions**,  **double-spend cryptos**, and  **stop the addition of new transactions**  to the blockchain.\n\n### Sybil Attacks\n\nAn online attack known as a  **sybil attack**  allows hackers to break into a network by taking over many machines or user accounts. Such attacks seek to seize control of a network in order to affect transactions and other network processes. These assaults often relate to a malevolent scammer running many nodes to take over a blockchain network in the Web3 environment.\n\nThe goal of the attacker is to significantly affect the network in order to engage in illicit actions while still abiding by the system’s core rules and regulations. Several IP address-based user accounts that, to an outsider looking in, appear to be distinct identities but are not can be created by a single machine or entity.\n\n### Smart Contract Immutability\n\nThe intransitive nature of  **smart contracts**  is one of the main problems that blockchains encounter. Immutability refers to the fact that once smart contracts are implemented on a blockchain, the protocol’s rules cannot be changed.\n\nThe fact that there is an opportunity for scammers to alter the contract details is the most disturbing factor. It is difficult to remedy a flaw discovered in the code since it is immutable. This limits the developers’ ability to provide solutions whenever an issue occurs.\n\nIn contrast to typical software defects, smart contracts can nonetheless have errors that are detrimental and have a significant impact. The Defi systems are now powered by smart contracts. This implies that a single flaw or vulnerability might result in significant losses for consumers.\n\n### Routing Attacks\n\nUnlike a 51 per cent attack, routing attacks focus on taking advantage of inherent flaws in the internet’s  **routing system**. A routing attack can be used by an attacker to divide a blockchain network into two different ones. As the attacker serves as a bridge between the two divisions, all network traffic passes through him. When the assault is eventually stopped, the blocks inside the smaller partition will all be deleted, forcing transactions to be dumped and repudiating any mining rewards. This forcibly builds parallel blockchains.\n\nSimilarly to this, routing attacks may also be employed to completely avoid detection while delaying the delivery of the mined block by at least 20 minutes on blockchain networks. This may lead to duplicate expenditures or mining power waste. Theoretically, these attacks are conceivable.\n\n### Consensus Protocol Attacks\n\nAnother form of vulnerability that might exist in blockchain technology is consensus protocol attacks. The methods that control how transactions are validated and added to the blockchain are known as “consensus protocols.”\n\n### Vulnerabilities in Blockchain User Endpoints\n\nSecurity in blockchain networks is subject to some gaps in user-interface devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones, just like any other online transaction service. An attacker attempting to gain access to your blockchain wallet may monitor your online activity around the clock or use malware to examine your files in search of the private key to your wallet.\n\nIt is crucial to keep your private key for your crypto wallet encrypted and avoid saving it as a plain text file. Also, installing safe antivirus software that guards against spyware is always advised.\n\n![Safety](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F3.png?alt=media)\n\n## Solutions For Blockchain Security\n\nThere are a number of **security solutions**  that can be integrated into blockchain technology in order to reduce the security issues mentioned above. Some of these remedies are:\n\n### Multi-Signature Authentication:\n\nBefore a transaction can be carried out, it needs to be approved by several parties. By doing so, fraud risk may be decreased and illegal access prevented.\n\n### Public and Private Key Cryptography\n\n**Security in blockchain** is ensured by **transactions**  that are protected by public and private key cryptography. To encrypt and decode transactions, each user has a public key and a private key. This makes sure that the funds can only be accessed by the specified recipient.\n\n### Auditing and Testing of Smart Contracts\n\n[Smart contract auditing](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/smart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide)  and testing can find weaknesses in smart contracts and make sure they work as intended.\n\n### Byzantine Fault Tolerance\n\nThis strategy allows a system to keep running even if some of its nodes malfunction or act maliciously. Attacks like Sybil attacks and 51% assaults may be avoided in this way.\n\n### Zero-Proof Knowledge\n\nIt is a cryptographic method that enables users to demonstrate their possession of certain information without divulging that information itself, making blockchain more secure and private.\n\n### Hashing Methods\n\nTo protect the integrity of transactions on the blockchain, hashing methods are utilized. Each transaction is given a distinct fingerprint, making it difficult to change the transaction without also altering the fingerprint.\n\n### Decentralized Exchanges\n\nUsers can trade cryptocurrencies on decentralized exchanges without depending on a centralized authority. Fraud and hacking risks can be decreased as a result of this methodology.\n\n![Web 3.0](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F4.png?alt=media)\n\n### Security in Blockchain this Year\n\nIn  **2023**, blockchain technology is expected to gain more popularity, and thus,  **security in blockchain is going to be a matter of high priority** for the organizations that are going to be adopting the Web 3.0 environment.\n\n**Increased Use of Decentralized Operations**\n\nWe may anticipate an increase in the number of companies and organizations using decentralized operations. As a result, stronger security measures will be required in order to safeguard the sensitive information and assets kept on these networks. The expansion of blockchain-based corporate operations is one of the top blockchain trends of 2023. More businesses are expected to take advantage of this technology because of the better security, transparency, and protection from cyberattacks that decentralized blockchains provide.\n\n### Interoperability\n\nAs blockchain networks continue to spread, it will become more and more crucial that they communicate with one another. Different blockchain networks will be able to connect with one another thanks to interoperability solutions, but these solutions will also bring forth new security issues that need to be resolved. Blockchain technology.\n\n### Secure Wallets\n\nMore software wallet integrations with various hardware wallets, also known as storage solutions, will also be seen, making it more difficult for thieves to access a victim’s money.\n\n### Quantum-Resistant Encryption\n\nAs quantum computing advances, it is possible that standard encryption techniques will be broken. Quantum-resistant encryption, which is built to fight against incoming attacks from quantum computers, has emerged as a result of this.\n\n### Zero-Knowledge Proofs\n\nAs data privacy concerns rise, blockchain developers are putting more effort into integrating privacy-focused features like zero-knowledge proofs and encryption to safeguard user data.\n\n### More Blockchain-Based Apps\n\nBlockchain software engineers will be in high demand in 2023. Blockchain technology will become increasingly necessary as more sophisticated ‘’Know Your Customer’’ [**(KYC)**](https://www.cyberscope.io/#kyc)  features, secure transactions, and other functions are developed.\n\n### MPC\n\nTechnology-based encryption will progress towards multi-party computation  **(MPC)**.  **Multi-factor authentication**, in which the user splits his key between a local wallet and a signature server, is one use of MPC. When a transaction has to be signed, those shards would cooperate, but they would also protect against a loss of cash if either were compromised, resulting in a much more safe and more secure cyber environment.\n\n### Account Abstraction\n\nIn 2023, there will be more discussion regarding ideas like “account abstraction.” Account abstraction, as well explained by Argent wallet creator and [Ethereum](https://www.cyberscope.io/ethereum-contract-audit)  cofounder  **Vitalik Buterin**, entails modifying Ethereum to basically make all addresses, not just smart contracts, programmable. This would allow cryptocurrency technology companies to investigate new solutions for securing wallets and improving the recovery of lost or stolen funds.\n\n### Blockchain Data Sharing\n\nIn 2023, user control over data ownership will be enabled via system designs for blockchain data sharing. Once they begin to “own” their data, users will be able to control who gets access to it. Healthcare, medical, and financial services will be the first to be impacted, but advertising and social media may also experience significant changes as a result of these new designs, suggests **Manjush Madabushi**, CTO and co-founder of Talentica Software.\n\n**Marijus Briedis**, CTO of NordVPN, said in 2022,  _“The next year will not be any easier when it comes to keeping users’ data safe and private. Authoritarian countries and hackers are working hard to compromise those factors. However, I see the light at the end of the tunnel because people are starting to value their data, pushing businesses and governments to take action’’_.\n\n![Trade and Value Chains](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsecurity-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023%2F5.png?alt=media)\n\n### Trade and Value Chains\n\nTraceability is made possible throughout the whole supply chain via blockchain technology. Blockchains allow for instantaneous access to the status or legitimacy of a product since they record data in a digital, decentralized ledger. In addition to increasing efficiency and defensibility, this also establishes a worldwide value chain for commodities in a more secure context.\n\nThe blockchain ecosystem, which many firms have adopted, will continue, and it must continue to include **smart contracts**. 2023 will be a year characterized by  **efficient, safe, and precise international transactions**.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Security in**  **blockchain technology**  will change as it develops. It is crucial for companies and developers to emphasize security in their blockchain initiatives if they want to remain ahead of these dangers. This entails that businesses and developers must put security first by establishing strong security measures, keeping up with the most recent security trends and technology, and adhering to **cybersecurity**  laws and standards in order to overcome these security problems. To keep blockchain technology safe, dependable, and robust, this call to action is crucial.
