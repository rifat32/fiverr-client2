BSC is completely compatible with the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** and is based on the Proof of Staked Authority (**PoSA**) consensus mechanism. It facilitates the development of decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts with quick confirmation times and minimal transaction costs.\n\nThe security, dependability, and integrity of tokens generated on the Binance Smart Chain are all things that can be ensured thanks to **BSC token audits**. Independent [security companies](https://www.cyberscope.io/services) carry out token audits to check the smart contract code of the token for flaws, defects, and potential exploits. Auditing can aid in the prevention of fraud, hacks, and other negative actions that might endanger investors and ruin the BSC ecosystem's image.\n\nIt is crucial for token developers to pick a trustworthy and knowledgeable audit company to carry out the audit. Also, they should make sure that they are totally open and honest with the audit company and give them all the information they want regarding the token and its smart contract code. To improve the security and usefulness of the token, token developers should adopt the recommendations and best practices detailed in the audit report.\n\n\n## Overview of the BSC Token Audit Process\n\n**Requesting an Audit**\n\nA [trusted security company](https://www.cyberscope.io/services) with expertise in smart contract auditing will accept requests for audits from token developers.\n\n**Pre-audit Analysis**\n\nIn order to find any possible flaws and determine the audit's scope and cost, the auditor will first examine the token's smart contract code.\n\n**Planning the Audit**\n\nThe auditor will create an audit plan that specifies the objectives, procedures, timetable, deliverables, and channels of communication for the audit.\n\n**Code Review**\n\nThe auditor will use tools and methods including human code review, automated testing, and static analysis to thoroughly examine the token's smart contract code. Finding any bugs, logical flaws, [security](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/security-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023) holes, or other problems that might jeopardize the token's functioning or security is the goal of this stage.\n\n![Code Review](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbinance_smart_chain_audits%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n**Testing and Analysis**\n\nTo confirm the accuracy and security of the token's smart contract code, the auditor will carry out a number of tests and analyses. Functional testing, unit testing, integration testing, and other tests may be part of this process.\n\n**Report Creation**\n\nThe auditor will provide a thorough audit report that describes the audit's findings and offers suggestions for enhancing the token's security and usability. Any vulnerabilities or problems should be listed in the report along with advice on how to fix or mitigate them.\n\n  \n\n**Follow-up and Support**\n\nThe auditor may offer the token creators follow-up help to make sure that any problems are appropriately resolved and that the token continues to be safe and useful. Further testing, analysis, and continuing advice and assistance could be necessary for this.\n\n  \n\n![Cyber Security](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbinance_smart_chain_audits%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\n  \n\n## Understanding Cross-Contract Dependencies\n\nCross-contract dependencies may appear while doing a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token audit since the token contract communicates with other blockchain contracts. The token contract, for instance, may be dependent on a contract that controls token distribution, or it might communicate with an exchange contract to enable trade.\n\nThe auditor must carefully examine any cross-contract dependencies in order to guarantee the token contract's security and operation. This involves the subsequent actions:\n\n**Identifying Every Contract That the Token Contract Engages With**\nAny contract that the token contract interacts with, including those on which it depends or calls functions, must be noted by the auditor.\n\n**Check the Security of the Contracts**\nThe auditor must examine the code, weaknesses, and potential attack points of every contract with which the token contract interfaces to confirm that it is secure.\n\n**Examine How the Contracts Interact**\nThe auditor must examine how the token contract interacts with any other contracts, particularly how data and tokens are transferred between them. This entails confirming the contracts' safe communication and the appropriate handling and validation of any data or tokens that are passed between them.\n\n**Checking the Contracts' Functionality**\nThe auditor must confirm that the contracts are operating as intended and that they adhere to the specifications of the token contract.\n\n**Testing the Contracts**\nTo guarantee that the token contract and all associated contracts are operating safely and appropriately, the auditor should subject them to comprehensive testing. This entails checking for edge instances, potential assaults, and any other situations that could affect the fulfilment of the contract.\n\n  \n\nIn general, it's crucial to comprehend cross-contract interdependence while auditing a BSC token contract. The auditor may make that the token contract and any associated contracts are safe, useful, and satisfy the project's needs by carrying out these stages.\n\n  \n\n## Improving BSC Token Audit - Additional Actions\n\nToken developers can take the following additional actions to further prepare for a BSC token audit in addition to the ones that have already been mentioned:\n  \n-   Making sure that the documentation for the **smart contract code is accurate**. As the auditor will have a better grasp of how the code functions, having clear and thorough documentation of the code may make the audit process easier and more effective.\n\n- **Internal testing and analysis**. It might be beneficial to perform some internal testing and analysis before submitting the code for an external audit to find any obvious defects or concerns. In the long term, this can save time and money because the auditor won't have to spend as much time finding and resolving these problems.\n\n- **Using open-source frameworks and libraries**. Code vulnerabilities and mistakes can be minimized by utilizing well-known, open-source libraries and frameworks. A range of automated testing tools are available that may assist in locating potential bugs and vulnerabilities in the code. Take into consideration employing these tools. These tools help speed up the auditing process and increase audit accuracy.\n\n- **Handling any problems that are found**. The auditor will deliver a report detailing any flaws or vulnerabilities found when the audit is finished. To maintain the security and operation of the token, token developers must be ready to fix these problems quickly and completely.\n\n![Audit](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbinance_smart_chain_audits%2F3.png?alt=media)\n\n## Phases the Auditing Process\n\nThe following phases are commonly included in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token audit process:\n\n**Evaluation of the Code and Contract for the Token**\n\nTo understand how the coin functions and any possible weaknesses, the auditor will first go over the contract and code. Both human and automated testing may be a part of this investigation.\n\nThe contract will be manually and automatically tested by the auditor in order to find any problems or weaknesses in the contract. Functional testing, unit testing, integration testing, and other types of testing may be included in this.\n\n**Identification and Reporting of Flaws and Vulnerabilities**\n\nThe token development team will be informed of any issues or vulnerabilities that are discovered throughout the testing process and will be documented in a report. The report will often provide thorough explanations of the problems along with suggestions for how to fix them.\n\nIn order to guarantee that the token development team is aware of the problems that have been found and how to fix them, the auditor will maintain constant communication with them. This can entail giving further instructions or information as necessary.\n\n## Post-Audit Activities\n\n**Repair and Retesting of any Issues Found**\nThe token development team will work to address any flaws or vulnerabilities discovered, and the auditor will retest the contract to ensure that the issues have been fixed. Once all issues are resolved and the contract is deemed trustworthy and safe, this procedure may continue until anything new has been detected.\n\nThe main objective of the BSC token audit process is to identify and address any issues or flaws that may compromise the token's security or functionality, as well as to ensure that the token is safe for users to use and trade.\n  \nMaking suggestions for enhancements and best practices is the second phase. The audit report must include suggestions for any enhancements or industry-recognized best practices that the token development team can use to increase the token's [security](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-smart-contract-security-audit) and functionality. These suggestions can involve making adjustments to the code, methods, or processes. For instance, the audit may point out places where the token's smart contract may be strengthened or extra security measures added. Token creators may make sure that the token is safe and useful in the long run by following these suggestions.\n\n![Post-Audit Activities](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbinance_smart_chain_audits%2F4.png?alt=media)\n\n## The Final Stage is Releasing the Audit Findings Publicly\n\nTo increase user confidence and trust, token developers should think about posting the audit report on the token's website or in a public repository. Users may see that the token has undergone a thorough audit and has been confirmed to be safe by making the audit report public. Users' trust and confidence may be increased as a result, which is crucial for any token's success.\n  \nUltimately, it's critical to keep checking on and maintaining the token's contract. Even once the audit is over, it is crucial to keep an eye out for any new vulnerabilities or problems that can develop with the token and its contract. This may entail instituting frequent security assessments, carrying out continuing maintenance and upgrades, and keeping abreast with the most recent industry standards and best practices. The token may be continuously monitored and maintained by the developers to guarantee that it is safe and useful.\n  \n## Conclusion\n\nFinally, frequent audits are essential to preserving the integrity and security of BSC tokens. These audits aid in locating and addressing any risks and vulnerabilities in the token's smart contract code, assuring the token's long-term security and functionality. Token creators may increase user trust and confidence, which is crucial for any token's success, by conducting routine audits. \n\nBefore making an investment, investors should learn about and comprehend the audit history of the token. It is wiser to **invest in a coin that has passed a comprehensive audit** and been determined to be **secure** rather than one that has not. Investors should also be aware of tokens with a spotty audit history or that haven't had any audits at all.\n\nTo preserve the security and integrity of tokens, BSC token audits are a crucial component. Token developers should make sure they conduct routine audits and adhere to the best practices and suggestions presented in the audit reports. Before making an investment, investors should learn about and comprehend a token's audit history to make sure their money is safe and reliable.\n\nIf you are looking to audit your BSC token, you can always reach out to us [here](https://www.cyberscope.io/#contact).","author":"Cyberscope Team","title":"Binance Smart Chain Audits: All You Need To Know","description":"Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network developed by Binance as an alternative to Ethereum for creating DApps and smart contracts.

A presale is a crowdfunding event that allows investors to purchase tokens before they are listed on exchanges. It is usually held by teams that are raising funds to develop their project. At the same time, investors have the opportunity to buy an altcoin that could be worth a lot more in the future. However, it is hard for them to be sure if their investments will be safe, as the projects that perform presales are in their early stages of development.\n\nIn the below article, we will describe how a Pinksale audit can be an essential tool in their decision, how crucial it is for the success of a presale and how you can get one.\n\n## What is Pinksale?\n\n[Pinksale Finance](https://www.pinksale.finance/) is a launchpad protocol that allows its users to create and launch tokens. The platform does not require coding knowledge, so anyone can generate their own token in only a few clicks. Furthermore, it offers additional features related to the token launch including LP locking, vesting options and automatic listing on exchanges such as PancakeSwap and UniSwap.\n\nEven though it originally provided services only on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), now it supports 6 more blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche networks. Pinksale is one of the most popular launchpad platforms in which users can create a presale for their token.\n\nTo keep both project owners and investors safe throughout the presale process, Pinksale offers two features: Anti-Rug and Anti-Bot systems. The Anti-Rug system gives owners the option to lock a part of their team tokens. Provided the team locks a sufficient amount of tokens for a period of time, users can be sure that the project will not be able to [rug pull](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/what-are-rug-pulls-and-how-you-can-avoid-getting-scammed) right after the presale ends. At the same time, the Anti-Bot system prevents automatic buy orders from bots, lowering the chances of investors being taken advantage of, in a potential price dump.\n\n## How Do Presales Work?\n\nA presale takes place before the official launch of an [Initial Coin Offering (ICO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico), during which the startup offers tokens to interested investors. The reason projects perform a presale is to raise funds for their operations until the official launch, when tokens will be available for everyone to buy.\n\nThe presale participants have the opportunity to buy the tokens at a lower price than if they bought them after the official launch. Of course, that benefits the investors. In case the value of the currency increases after its launch, their holdings will be worth a lot more. Although presale-stage investments can be lucrative, there are some risks to consider. If a presale campaign does not conclude as planned and the project token fails to launch officially, the investors can find themselves owning tokens of no value.\n\n![How Do Presales Work?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fhow-to-get-a-pinksale-audit%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n## Why Do You Need a Smart Contract Audit for your Presale?\n\nSmart contracts may be vulnerable to hacking, resulting in irreversible losses. Each year, billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies are lost to [cyberattacks](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/the-most-common-defi-hacks-and-how-to-protect-against-them) worldwide. Since smart contracts involve financial transactions, it is important to be error-free. Otherwise, hackers may be able to use code flaws to their advantage and steal crypto assets that can not be recovered. Therefore, project owners have to be sure that their contracts are safe and protected from malicious actions. That is why they invest in [smart contract audits](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-audit-a-smart-contract).\n\nA smart security audit is a process of checking a contract’s source code for any defects in order to ensure that it is functioning as intended. The process entails both automated and manual checks of the code for the auditors to gain a comprehensive understanding of the contract’s functionality and purpose. Furthermore, a careful examination of the code’s structure can reveal potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by external actors.\n\nAn audit report is a valuable tool for both project owners and investors. It can help the developers of the team to identify bugs or security fractures in the code that could be abused by third parties and fix them before the presale begins. Furthermore, it will provide users with all the information they need about the project in which they consider investing and warn them of possible dangers.\n\n## How Can You Get a Pinksale Audit?\n\nFollowing the need of users to trust a project before they invest, a badge section has been introduced for the presale system of Pinksale. The badges represent various security certifications the project has earned and can help users make better investment decisions.\n\nThere are 4 different badges that a project can earn for the Pinksale presale phase:\n\n**Audit Badge:** This badge means that the contract of the token has been reviewed and audited for possible vulnerabilities.\n\n**KYC Badge:** By getting the KYC badge, the team proves that one or more of its core members passed through the Know your Customer process.\n\n**SAFU Badge:** The SAFU badge indicates that the contract has been developed by an official Pinksale-approved developer. SAFU contract have various requirements that ensure the contract is safe for investors and cannot be manipulated by the project owners.\n\n**Doxx Badge: **The Doxx Badge is an extension of the KYC badge. The project team proves the identities of its members by publishing a Youtube video and an AMA (Ask me Anything) session.\n\nGetting badges for a project’s presale can increase your chances of finding more investors as they use them as criteria to evaluate their investment decisions.\n\n![A Pinksale Audit](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fhow-to-get-a-pinksale-audit%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nΑ smart contract audit, ιn addition to the security insights it offers, can certainly increase the chances of a successful presale in Pinksale. The information it contains can be used by the project owners to improve the contract before the official launch. A pinksale audit is also vital for traders that want to have an unbiased review of the project before they decide to invest their funds.

Everyone wants to create their own cryptocurrency and be the next popular token that the crypto community will go crazy over. Having a smart contract for your token is only one half of the equation since you also need to ensure that the contract is safe to use by you and the investors.\n\nIn this article, we will go over the most popular kind of token, the BSC-based one, and how it is important to get a BSC token audit to check the security and functionality of the project.\n\n## What is a BSC Token\n\nBSC stands for Binance Smart Chain. It is the chain created by Binance, that also uses its native token, the BNB. A BSC token is a token created on the Binance chain since this chain is currently the most preferred one among new projects.\n\nThe Binance Smart Chain is based on Ethereum, so by being EVM-compatible, it gives developers the opportunity to create or migrate DApps, tools, and other components without experiencing any obstacles along the way.\n\nThe average transaction fees are 5 Gwei on BSC compared to 40 Gwei on Ethereum. This means it’s 8x cheaper to run a dApp on BSC.\n\nAt the time of writing, Binance smart chain is one of the world’s fastest blockchains. BSC is well known for its lightning-fast transactions, with blocks made every 3 seconds. Ethereum on the other hand takes 13 seconds to create a block.\n\nAs one of the most popular exchanges, BSC’s credibility runs across all its platforms. On top of that, the exchange vets every validator on the network and that ensures that on-chain development is both secure and reliable.\n\nBy utilizing the strengths of BSC and its native token, projects enjoy the chain’s transaction speed, low fees, and popularity. This is a great starting point for new projects since it provides a strong foundation that they can build on, for their own token.\n\n![What is an audit?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbsc-token-audit-a-complete-guide%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n## What is an audit\n\nSmart contracts (also known as blockchain contracts) are self-executing contracts with the terms of an agreement between buyer and seller written into lines of code. The code is stored, distributed, and replicated on a blockchain network.\n\nA [smart contract audit](https://medium.com/coinmonks/smart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide-39781ef2c972) is a full review of a smart contract’s source code that checks for vulnerabilities, optimization issues, and any kind of defects that might disrupt the contract’s intended functionality. In the end, you get a detailed report containing all findings along with recommended fixes by the engineers that audited the code.\n\nThe audit report is an important aspect of the smart contract creation process. The developer will use it as a way to check for vulnerabilities in their code, which external actors could exploit. The audit report also offers investors and users of a contract reassurance that the contract behaves as expected, which enables them to safely interact with it.\n\n## Why is it important to audit a BSC Token\n\nAs with any smart contract, BSC Tokens are subject to vulnerabilities. They can be exploited if not programmed correctly and can suffer from operational issues that can prove devastating for a project. Especially new projects that aim to take over the industry and become a reference point for future entrepreneurs.\n\nBy getting a BSC token audit you can get information on the integrity of the smart contract and find out if there are any issues that should be addressed. The report also includes recommendations on possible fixes for each finding. This includes security, performance, or business logic findings.\n\nIn recent months, there have been many cybersecurity attacks that resulted in huge sums of money being lost. In 2022 alone, more than [$3 billion were stolen according to recent reports](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-hackers-steal-3-billion-in-2022-set-to-be-biggest-year-for-digital-asset-heists-9347301.html). These could have been prevented if the contracts were properly developed and underwent a thorough audit process. There are also cases of severe contract malfunctions which, while not resulting in direct loss of funds, make investors abandon the project to protect their assets. In such cases, the project’s integrity (and trust) takes a hit, making it less likely to be a long-term success.\n\n## The process of auditing a BSC Token\n\nThere are different ways to audit a BSC Token, the most common being manual and automatic audits.\n\nMost audit providers choose the automatic auditing approach for this service. The source code of the BSC Token smart contract is analyzed by AI tools, checking it against the most common and known issues. It gives a well-rounded coverage of security vulnerabilities and performance concerns. One of the downsides of such methods is that, by being an automated process, it cannot check for well-hidden threats that could be part of the code. This could be accounted to malicious contract devs or bad programming. It is also unable to discover potential business logic concerns.\n\nEven though getting a BSC token audit with the help of an automated tool yields faster results, there are only so many things that an AI can identify. As contracts get more complex and include interactions with other contracts or wallet addresses, the value of an automated check decreases.\n\nThe manual audit on the other hand, while more time-consuming, it is considered to be the better approach. Each line of the smart contract is carefully examined to account for security vulnerabilities, performance issues as well as faults in business logic. More sophisticated manual audits include other tests as well, like unit tests. Unit tests are for checking the contract’s behaviour in different scenarios and edge cases. This can prove invaluable, especially for large-scale projects.\n\nLeading cybersecurity companies in the crypto space utilize both automatic and manual methods. This is to ensure that everything is checked and the highest possible quality of audit is delivered as an end result.\n\n## Why choose Cyberscope\n\n[Cyberscope](https://www.cyberscope.io/) is one of the leading audit companies in the crypto space. With more than 1000+ clients, its brand name has become recognizable and sought-after in the space.\n\nThey are partners with all major launchpads, that BSC token owners can use to launch their projects and get the related badges. Furthermore, their recent partnerships like the [Polygon Village program and the RadRugs](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/topics/cyberscope) are proof of how Cyberscope is the go-to cybersecurity specialist for smart contract audits. Their very own automated contract analysis tool, Cyberscan is being used in the [GeckoTerminal](https://cyberscope.medium.com/cyberscope-partners-with-geckoterminal-c98bced34375) platform, as a means to help potential investors be able to identify issues in the smart contract of projects they are researching.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA BSC token audit is the most important step for any project. By auditing your token’s contract you secure your project and provide investors with the safety that they are looking for. It is also important to consider launchpad badges.\n\nLaunchpads introduced various badges, to give investors a straightforward way to identify projects that have completed various milestones. The most common ones are the audit and the KYC badges. Investors are on the lookout for projects that have these badges, as they add to the project’s security and credibility. These can be obtained by getting each related service from verified providers of each launchpad platform. So if you are planning to use a launchpad for the presale of your BSC token, you can get both your BSC token audit and related badge, by going with a verified provider.\n\nThis article has hopefully given you a better understanding of what a BSC Token is and why it is important to invest in an audit.

In fact, recent studies have shown that 61% of enterprises claimed to have plans for integrating blockchain technology into their core business procedures. However, a major problem to the adoption of Smart Contracts is wrapped around trust and lack of regulatory frameworks. There are few, if any, applicable laws to resolve disputes arising from automated business transactions.\r\n\r\nWith the increasing importance of smart contract security, audits have become one of the most common ways to secure blockchains. In the below article, we will analyze how much time takes for an audit to be completed and what it may cost.\r\n\r\n## What is a Smart Contract Audit and Why is it Important?\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of an agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code is stored, distributed, and replicated on a blockchain network. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. The blockchain can be used to trace transactions and make them transparent for all parties involved.\r\n\r\nA [crypto security audit](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/how-to-do-a-basic-crypto-security-audit-to-your-smart-contract) focuses on a smart contract’s source code to ensure that it is functioning as intended. Auditors use automated checks and manual reviews of the code to get an overall picture of how the contract is operating and its purpose.\r\n\r\nThe audit report is important for developers as it allows them to check for vulnerabilities in their code, which could be exploited by external actors. In that way, they can ensure that the contract cannot behave in ways that it was not meant to. It can also offer the investors and users of the contract the trust and reassurance they need to interact with the contract safely.\r\n\r\n## How Many Types of Smart Contracts are There?\r\n\r\nBefore we analyze the factors that may affect the cost and the timeframe of an audit, let’s see the 3 types of contracts that exist out there:\r\n\r\n**1. Smart Legal Contract**\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are legal agreements that are executed automatically. They have the same requirements as traditional contracts, such as mutual assent, expressed by a valid offer and acceptance; adequate consideration; capacity; and legality. When set up properly, smart contracts are legally enforceable and require parties to fulfill their obligations. If a party fails to fulfill its obligations, the contract can trigger automatic legal action against the party in breach.\r\n\r\n**2. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations**\r\n\r\n[DAO](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/what-is-a-dao-and-how-to-create-one) stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization and describes a community that exists on the blockchain. This community is defined by a set of agreed-upon rules coded as smart contracts, which are enforced by all participants. Each participant’s actions are subject to these rules, and the task of enforcing them is shared among all participants in the network. The rules themselves are made up of many smart contracts that work together to keep track of activities in the DAO.\r\n\r\n![Decentralized Autonomous Organizations](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fhow-much-does-it-cost-to-audit-a-smart-contract%2F1.png?alt=media)\r\n\r\n**3. Application Logic Contracts**\r\n\r\nApplication logic contracts (ALCs) are a crucial component of multi-functional smart contracts. They enable communication across different devices and allow for the merging of IoT technology with blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nSmart contracts possess all the qualities necessary to carry out a transaction with a high degree of precision, safety, and efficiency. Because smart contracts are written in code, however, it is not easy for everyone to create one from the scratch without having a background in computer programming.\r\n\r\n## How Much Time Does it Take For an Audit to be Completed?\r\n\r\nAs you can already tell from the various types of smart contracts out there, the timeframe that an audit needs to be completed depends on many parameters. Let’s discuss the more crucial ones below:\r\n\r\n**Size**\r\n\r\nThe first and most important factor to consider for an audit is the project’s size. For instance, if you want a simple contract of ERC20 or BEP20 tokens to get audited, then you can get the audit report just within 48 hours. However, if the token is part of a Dapp, it won’t be possible to examine the code within the same timeframe. The audit process can take up to a couple of weeks to complete it. The type of contract also plays an important role in determining how quickly your company can expect its smart contract audit results. Advanced ERC20 contracts have more features than basic ones and therefore take longer to audit than basic ones.\r\n\r\n**Complexity**\r\n\r\nWhen determining the complexity of your project, consider how much time will be required for auditors to complete their work. The more functions and custom code a contract includes the more time is needed for the auditors to analyze it and run all the tests.

They also ensure that smart contracts are adhering to their intrinsic business logic, as well as identifying edge cases and optimizing code for gas use. Unit tests are also included as part of the manual audit process of a smart contract.\r\n\r\n**Automated auditing** is a method of scanning code for defects using [audit tools](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/free-smart-contract-audit-tools-for-investors). It guarantees that all aspects of smart contracts are covered, leaving no room for human mistakes. The automated audit may take up to one day for ERC20/BEP20 contracts.\r\n\r\n## What is The Cost of a Smart Contract Audit?\r\n\r\nCompanies that provide smart contract audit services charge from $1,000 to $15,000 on average. However, the price can be even higher in some cases. As you can understand, the expenses of development, deployment and technical support for smart contracts can become prohibitively high. Nevertheless, smart contract auditing is always recommended, as even a single bug in code may result in even higher costs, eventually.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe hope that these insights will give you a good idea of what to expect when performing a smart contract audit.

However, when it comes to smart contracts, we are talking about simple blocks of code that run on top of a blockchain network. This means that they will follow the rules and protocols specified in the code. If something goes wrong, smart contracts may not be able to deliver what they are promising.\n\nAuditing is an important process for ensuring the success of a business or a project. By auditing the scope, intended behavior, overall architecture and code, auditors can help ensure that all aspects of the project are up to standards and safe for the users.\n\nIn this article, we will try to give you a better understanding of how a basic crypto security audit works and why it is important in blockchain technology.\n\n## What is a Smart Contract Audit?\n\nIn a more detailed description, smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. This code is stored, distributed, and replicated on a blockchain network. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. They render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.\n\nHowever, just because they are “smart” doesn’t mean they’re foolproof. A security audit is an integral part of smart contract security. As an ecosystem like this is inextricably linked with its code, a security analysis of the smart contracts is an essential asset to secure its functionality. This is the point where security audits come into play.\n\nA [crypto security audit](https://www.cyberscope.io/#audit) is a process of checking a contract’s source code for any defects, in order to ensure that it is functioning as intended and is not susceptible to errors. Through automated audits and manual checks of the code, the auditors can acquire a detailed overview of the overall functionality of the contract and its purpose. In addition, a thorough review of the code structure will spot dangerous security fractures that can be abused in a malicious way.\n\n## Why is a Smart Contract Audit Important?\n\nΑ crypto security audit is of big importance to developers as it allows them to check for vulnerabilities in their code that could possibly be exploited by external actors and provide them with a solution on how to fix them. In that way, they can ensure that the contract cannot behave in ways that it was not meant to.\n\nSmart contracts are different from other programs because they typically involve finances. In every function execution, a transaction is recorded on the blockchain involving fee consumption. Thus, a faulty smart contract will contain errors that may allow hackers to steal the crypto stored in it. A crypto security audit report can offer the investors and users of the contract a sense of trust and reassurance that they can interact with the contract safely.\n\n![Why is a Smart Contract Audit Important?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fhow-to-do-a-basic-crypto-security-audit-to-your-smart-contract%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n## How to audit a basic smart contract?\n\nThe process of a basic crypto security audit could be divided into 8 steps described below:\n\n**1. Requirement Gathering and Scope Definition**\n\nIn order to properly audit a project, access to key documents is essential. These can include the business requirement document, project whitepaper/ yellow paper, technical specification document, and smart contract code. Other relevant information may also be taken into account, such as the overall architecture and intended business behavior. All of this contributes to determining the audit scope and its eventual goal.\n\n**2. Unit Testing**\n\nUnit testing is an important software development technique that helps ensure the quality of the code. By isolating individual pieces of code (units), auditors can more easily identify and fix errors and prevent them from becoming major problems.\n\n**3. Automated Data Processing and Analysis**\n\nAn automated security vulnerability scanner can be a valuable tool in assessing the security of your smart contract. It can give the auditor a head start on deciphering the code before the manual analyzing approach, by identifying potential bugs and vulnerabilities. There are plenty of automated auditing tools online that can prove useful like [Cyberscan ](https://www.cyberscope.io/cyberscan)and [CoinTool](https://cointool.app/audit).\n\n**4. Manual Auditing**\n\nManual code analysis is a process where experienced developers examine the code line by line in order to check for potential issues. This approach is more complex and thorough than other methods and can help to detect hidden problems that may not be apparent from simply inspecting the code with an automated tool.\n\n**5. Contract Structure Misuse**\n\nAs with any piece of code, smart contracts are not perfect. One of the ways they can be misused is by using the wrong code structure. In the scope of the Audit, these misuses must be spotted as they can lead to errors and weak points that can be abused by hackers.\n\n**6. Contract Logic Concerns**\n\nFollowing the structure misuse, it is also important for logical concerns in the contract code to be analyzed and fixed in order to prevent external actors from taking advantage of them for their own purposes.\n\n**7. Optimization Via Gas Analysis**\n\nThe Auditing process is not limited to blockchain security. It also looks at efficiency and optimization. Contracts may require a number of transactions to complete their function, incurring gas fees -charges that are required for a transaction to be completed in the blockchain- that can be costly. Inefficient steps will add extra cost to the transactions. Furthermore, unreasonable max gas limits in the contract may result in security breaches and transaction reverts.\n\n**8. Final Report**\n\nAfter a smart contract has undergone testing, automatic analysis, and human evaluation, an audit report is created. This report includes any vulnerabilities or problems that were found during the auditing process and recommendations on how to fix them. The audit team and the project team can then discuss the findings of the report and the level of their severity. This conversation helps project managers and developers to understand the issues identified by the audit team.\n\n![The audit team and the project team discuss the findings of the report](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fhow-to-do-a-basic-crypto-security-audit-to-your-smart-contract%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are many ways to approach smart contract auditing, but the overall goal is always to ensure that the smart contract will function as intended and that there are no vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Thanks to the development of [advanced tools](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/free-smart-contract-audit-tools-for-investors) to automate smart contract auditing, the process is becoming easier over time. However, we are still some way off from having a sophisticated enough ecosystem to reach the level, manual auditing can.

Blockchain technology, that is powering cryptocurrencies has seen many uses in the past years from payments to supply-chain management and many more. While you might be mostly reading about images of apes and [rocks being sold for millions](\u003chttps://inshorts.com/en/news/nft-of-a-picture-of-a-rock-sells-for-over-$13-million-1629816775091#:~:text=NFT%20of%20a%20picture%20of%20a%20rock%20sells%20for%20over%20%241.3%20million\u0026text=A%20non%2Dfungible%20token%20(NFT,sold%20on%20the%20Ethereum%20blockchain.)\u003e) and dog-themed coins reaching billions in market cap, there are significant technology advancements that have been made through the use of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of blockchain is smart contracts. It’s what makes blockchain technology go beyond a simple virtual currency and allows terms to be executed as part of a transaction. It goes without saying that making sure that all the terms (or code) that are included in the smart contract need be flawless in order to make sure that the transaction is not exploited by malicious actors. And that’s where smart contract audits come in.\n​\nIn this post, we’ll give you a complete overview of what are smart contract audits, how they work, why they are needed and some free tools that will help you with your smart contracts. Whether you are an investor, a developer or simply are looking to learn more about smart contract audits this is the guide for you.\n\n## What Is a Smart Contract?\n\n![What Is a Smart Contract?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsmart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\nSmart contracts are simply terms (or programs) that are stored on a blockchain and are executed when certain conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of a contract or agreement without the involvement of a third party. It is a way for the participants of the agreement to be certain of a certain and immediate outcome.\n\n​The concept of smart contracts was introduced (believe it or not) 10 years before the invention of bitcoin. It was first proposed in 1994 by [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo), a computer scientist and cryptographer, with the goal of bringing practices of contract law to the internet. It is one of the reasons that many think Szabo might actually be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. However, Szabo has repeatedly denied any such rumours.\n\n​Smart contracts were initially defined as computerized transaction protocols that execute the terms of a contract or agreement. Szabo’s vision was to extend the functionality of electronic transaction methods, such as POS (point of sale), to the internet.\n\nIn his paper, Szabo also proposed the execution of a contract for synthetic assets, such as derivatives and bonds. Szabo wrote: “These new securities are formed by combining securities (such as bonds) and derivatives (options and futures) in a wide variety of ways. Very complex term structures for payments can now be built into standardized contracts and traded with low transaction costs, due to computerized analysis of these complex term structures.”\n\nIn simple words, he was talking about the sale and purchase of derivatives with complex terms. Many of Szabo’s proposals and predictions in the paper came true in ways preceding blockchain technology. For example, derivatives trading is now mostly conducted through computer networks using complex term structures.\n\n## What Is a Smart Contract Audit?\n\n![What Is a Smart Contract Audit?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsmart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\nA smart contract audit is a process during which a smart contract is thoroughly analysed and reviewed for any potential vulnerabilities. The auditor will review the business logic and the code of the contract and will make sure that there are not any flaws that can be exploited.\n\n[Smart contract audits](https://www.cyberscope.io/#audit) will usually include a report that will be shared with the relevant parties (usually investors and the developers of the contract) detailing all suggested improvements to address any performance and security issues.\n\nThe auditors typically work closely with the developers of the smart contract to make sure all potential vulnerabilities are addressed. It is at this stage that the final report will be made public to the investors of the project to decide whether they want to invest in the project or not.\n\n## Why Is a Smart Contract Audit Important?\n\n​![Why Is a Smart Contract Audit Important?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsmart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide%2F3.png?alt=media)\n\nWith cryptocurrency scams reaching all-time highs and the most recent one (at the time of writing this) reaching a [whopping $614M](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/the-top-10-cryptocurrency-hacks-of-all-time) it is imperative for everyone interacting with smart contracts to make sure they are properly audited.​\n\nThere are usually two main parties that are interested in smart contract audits, investors and blockchain developers. For investors, it is a crucial part of their research process (commonly referred to as DYOR). They want to make sure the project they will invest in is free of any potential exploits and the developers have taken all the suggested actions suggested by the auditors. It is not uncommon for developers to purposely create a malicious smart contract in order to take advantage of investors. If you are thinking of investing in a new cryptocurrency make sure it’s properly audited and read thoroughly the audit report to make sure your investment is safe.\n\nFor developers, on the other hand, a smart contract audit will help them identify potential issues in the code that they might have missed. An experienced auditor will identify quickly potential flaws in the business logic and vulnerabilities and help them fix them before taking the project live.\n\n## How To Do A Smart Contract Audit?\n\n![How To Do A Smart Contract Audit?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsmart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide%2F4.png?alt=media)\n\n​Generally, smart contract security audits are performed by cyber security firms that are specialised in finding code vulnerabilities. That said, if you are well-versed in programming languages like solidity or rust, there are certain checks you can perform by yourself before consulting with an expert.\n\nBefore deeping into the code, the first thing you need to do is to define the scope of your audit. There are many aspects to smart contract audits from checking the business logic, analysing transaction costs or gas, performance review and checking for vulnerabilities. Defining your audit scope will help you come up with a test plan and a strategy on how you will audit the smart contract.\n\nOnce you have come up with your test strategy, you will need to start thinking about what tools to use to make your life easier. Some smart contracts can be quite large and dynamic to be monited effectively manually. In some cases, even after a project goes live, you need a system to continually monitor the transactions and inform the participants immediately if something fishy is discovered. Here are some popular tools auditors use as part of their process:\n\n- [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)\n- [Securify](https://github.com/eth-sri/securify2)\n- [SmartCheck](https://tool.smartdec.net/)\n- [Oyente](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/633.pdf)\n- [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril)\n- [MythX](http://MythX)\n- [Remix](https://remix-project.org/) plugins\n\nAfter identifying the right tools for you, it’s time to get to work. The tools above will give some initial findings that they might be able to detect like suicidal functions or reentrancy vulnerabilities, but it’s up to you, the auditor, to go line-by-line and check for further vulnerabilities or optimisations that can be made.\n\n## Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities\n\n​In case you are not familiar with some common vulnerabilities that are found in smart contracts, we’ve made a list of the most common ones.\n\n### Lack of Verification Checks\n\nOne of the most common issues seen in smart contracts and in generic programming is the lack of verification of the function parameters. Certain operations need to have necessary checks in order to be valid and most of the times developers forget or omit to add these checks to their code.\n\nA common case of such vulnerability might include missing checks to see if an unauthorised user has enough balance to perform a specific operation. Another good example is access control, where only certain types of users should be allowed to call a certain function, but this verification is never done or if you leave a certain function as public instead of “OnlyOwner”. This is the simplest and yet most common form of exploits that you will see in new smart contracts.\n\n### Re-entrancy Attacks\n\nA reentrancy attack happens when a function in the smart contract calls another external one in an untrusted contract. Then the untrusted contract that is being calls makes a recursive call back to the original function in an attempt to drain the funds of the initial contract.​\n\nWhen the contract fails to update its state before sending funds, the attacker can continuously call the withdraw function to drain the smart contract’s funds. At the time of this writing the most recent re-entrancy attack was on the [Fei Protocol](https://halborn.com/explained-the-fei-protocol-hack-april-2022/). In April 2022, it became the victim of a $80 million hack that was made possible by its use of third-party code containing re-entrancy vulnerabilities.​\n\n### Gas Optimization\n\nNot a vulnerability per see, but gas analysis during smart contract audits is an important aspect of the process. Blockchain networks such as Ethereum need to use ‘gas’ in the form of Ether to cover the costs of transactions. Gas prices may vary depending on the complexity and the lentght of the smart contract. So it goes without saying that you should always check your code for any unusude functions. A good example of that is the SafeMath library. If you only use the uint256, add a function for the operations you need and then remove the rest from the contract.\n\n### Incorrect Calculations​\n\nAnother common vulnerability with smart contracts is incorrect calculations. This vulnerability, also referred as arithmetic underflow or overflow, means that if some calculations are left uncheck the result that the calculation will product will be a number outside the range of the data type that stores them are performed. For example a uint8 variable, can only store integers between 0 and 255. Trying to store any value higher than 255 into a uint8 will result in zero. This can cause problems when performing calculations causing your smart contract to malfunction.​\n\n### Mint/Blacklist Functions\n\nFinally, we couldn’t leave outside common functions like the mint token function and the blacklist function. These functions might be used maliciously by the project owner to turn the contract into a ‘[honeypot](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/what-is-a-honeypot)’, meaning no-one can sell any tokens. If you find these functions in the smart contract of a token you are looking to invest in be very cautious and make sure you understand why they exist.​\n\n## **Automated Smart Contract Audits**\n\n![Screenshot  of  Cyberscan  Smart  Contract  Audit  Software](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsmart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide%2F5.png?alt=media)\n\nIf you are not familiar with programming and you are looking to review a smart contract without an audit report there are a few [free tools you can use](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/free-smart-contract-audit-tools-for-investors). One of the most common smart contract audit software used by investors to do a quick security analysis is [Cyberscan](https://www.coinscope.co/cyberscan).\n\nThe software is pretty easy to use, all you need to do is type the smart contract address you want to analyse, select the blockchain network from the dropdown, and press “Search”. You will then get to see a full report from the desired smart contract, as well as some key indicators like if the contract ownership was renounced or if the contract contains any common exploits (like blacklist or mint function). Finally, you can check the similarity of the code of your contract versus popular forks. This will help you understand if it’s minted from a specific platform and how unique it is.\n\n## Top Smart Contract Audit Companies\n\nPerforming your own security audit of your contract or using free software tools available out there, is by no means a replacement for hiring an experienced cyber security company. These companies employ experienced professionals with many years of experience under their belt that will help you make sure you didn’t miss anything.\n\nHowever, there are dozens of companies out there performing smart contract audits, how do you choose one? We’ve put together a list of the best smart contract audit firms, separating them into two tiers, premium smart contract audit companies that have higher pricing and are working with top market cap projects and standard smart contract audit companies that offer more affordable rates for cryptocurrency projects that are just starting out.\n\n## Premium Tier Audits\n\n### **1. Certik**\n\n![Certik](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsmart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide%2F6.png?alt=media)\n\nFounded in 2018 and recently crowned as a [2-times unicorn](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/07/goldman-sachs-joins-other-investors-in-88m-round-for-web3-and-blockchain-security-firm-certik/), Certik is the biggest name in the auditing space.

They employ a team of experienced solidity smart contract auditors that can perform audits for tokens, NFTs, crowdsales, marketplaces, gambling games, financial protocols, and more. They claim to leverage a combination of static analysis, automated tools, and a robust manual review process to provide industry-leading security recommendations to project teams.\n\nUnlike Cyberscope and Solidproof, Solidity Finance does not offer KYC services to projects yet.\n\n## How Much Does A Smart Contract Audit Cost?\n\nA smart contract audit can set you back from a few hundred dollars to a few hundred thousand depending on the complexity of your smart contract. Auditors will usually give you a personalised quote based on your contract complexity, the number of lines of code and the business logic behind it.\n\nAlbeit it might appear expensive to new project owners, a smart contract audit should be considered an investment rather than a cost. Smart contract audits will attract more investors to the project and make sure the funds that are involved in the transactions are safe. A lot of new cryptocurrency projects are aware of this and use the audits as the pillar to their marketing strategy helping them attract investors early on, as they are able to assure them that the contract will be [SAFU](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/secure-asset-fund-for-users).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this (not so short) guide we covered all the aspects that you need to know about smart contract security audits. It’s become clear that they add a new form of assurance that the code will work as intended before it is deployed, which protects investors and other stakeholders. The service improves the trust in smart contracts that have traditionally been surrounded by distrust because of breaches in security and hacks.\n\nSmart contract auditing services can also promote compliance with laws and regulations protecting investors as well as users from certain industries from illegal activities. There’s no shortage of auditors that perform smart contract audits, all with different scopes, levels of expertise, and price ranges. If you are considering utilizing a smart contract auditor for your ICO or future project, you’ll want to be sure to fully understand the scope of their audit, how much it costs and what to expect from the audit process itself.\n","author":"Cyberscope Team","title":"Smart  Contract  Audits :  A  Complete  Guide","description":"In this post, we’ll give you a complete overview of what are smart contract audits, how they work, why they are needed and some free tools that will help you with your smart contracts.","cover":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fsmart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide%2Fcover.png?alt=media","created":"2022-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","category":"Audit","domains":[]},{"id":"free-smart-contract-audit-tools-for-investors","content":"\nBlockchain technology and smart contracts are booming.

BSC is completely compatible with the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** and is based on the Proof of Staked Authority (**PoSA**) consensus mechanism. It facilitates the development of decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts with quick confirmation times and minimal transaction costs.\n\nThe security, dependability, and integrity of tokens generated on the Binance Smart Chain are all things that can be ensured thanks to **BSC token audits**. Independent [security companies](https://www.cyberscope.io/services) carry out token audits to check the smart contract code of the token for flaws, defects, and potential exploits. Auditing can aid in the prevention of fraud, hacks, and other negative actions that might endanger investors and ruin the BSC ecosystem's image.\n\nIt is crucial for token developers to pick a trustworthy and knowledgeable audit company to carry out the audit. Also, they should make sure that they are totally open and honest with the audit company and give them all the information they want regarding the token and its smart contract code. To improve the security and usefulness of the token, token developers should adopt the recommendations and best practices detailed in the audit report.\n\n\n## Overview of the BSC Token Audit Process\n\n**Requesting an Audit**\n\nA [trusted security company](https://www.cyberscope.io/services) with expertise in smart contract auditing will accept requests for audits from token developers.\n\n**Pre-audit Analysis**\n\nIn order to find any possible flaws and determine the audit's scope and cost, the auditor will first examine the token's smart contract code.\n\n**Planning the Audit**\n\nThe auditor will create an audit plan that specifies the objectives, procedures, timetable, deliverables, and channels of communication for the audit.\n\n**Code Review**\n\nThe auditor will use tools and methods including human code review, automated testing, and static analysis to thoroughly examine the token's smart contract code. Finding any bugs, logical flaws, [security](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/security-in-blockchain-the-landscape-in-2023) holes, or other problems that might jeopardize the token's functioning or security is the goal of this stage.\n\n![Code Review](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbinance_smart_chain_audits%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n**Testing and Analysis**\n\nTo confirm the accuracy and security of the token's smart contract code, the auditor will carry out a number of tests and analyses. Functional testing, unit testing, integration testing, and other tests may be part of this process.\n\n**Report Creation**\n\nThe auditor will provide a thorough audit report that describes the audit's findings and offers suggestions for enhancing the token's security and usability. Any vulnerabilities or problems should be listed in the report along with advice on how to fix or mitigate them.\n\n  \n\n**Follow-up and Support**\n\nThe auditor may offer the token creators follow-up help to make sure that any problems are appropriately resolved and that the token continues to be safe and useful. Further testing, analysis, and continuing advice and assistance could be necessary for this.\n\n  \n\n![Cyber Security](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbinance_smart_chain_audits%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\n  \n\n## Understanding Cross-Contract Dependencies\n\nCross-contract dependencies may appear while doing a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token audit since the token contract communicates with other blockchain contracts. The token contract, for instance, may be dependent on a contract that controls token distribution, or it might communicate with an exchange contract to enable trade.\n\nThe auditor must carefully examine any cross-contract dependencies in order to guarantee the token contract's security and operation. This involves the subsequent actions:\n\n**Identifying Every Contract That the Token Contract Engages With**\nAny contract that the token contract interacts with, including those on which it depends or calls functions, must be noted by the auditor.\n\n**Check the Security of the Contracts**\nThe auditor must examine the code, weaknesses, and potential attack points of every contract with which the token contract interfaces to confirm that it is secure.\n\n**Examine How the Contracts Interact**\nThe auditor must examine how the token contract interacts with any other contracts, particularly how data and tokens are transferred between them. This entails confirming the contracts' safe communication and the appropriate handling and validation of any data or tokens that are passed between them.\n\n**Checking the Contracts' Functionality**\nThe auditor must confirm that the contracts are operating as intended and that they adhere to the specifications of the token contract.\n\n**Testing the Contracts**\nTo guarantee that the token contract and all associated contracts are operating safely and appropriately, the auditor should subject them to comprehensive testing. This entails checking for edge instances, potential assaults, and any other situations that could affect the fulfilment of the contract.\n\n  \n\nIn general, it's crucial to comprehend cross-contract interdependence while auditing a BSC token contract. The auditor may make that the token contract and any associated contracts are safe, useful, and satisfy the project's needs by carrying out these stages.\n\n  \n\n## Improving BSC Token Audit - Additional Actions\n\nToken developers can take the following additional actions to further prepare for a BSC token audit in addition to the ones that have already been mentioned:\n  \n-   Making sure that the documentation for the **smart contract code is accurate**. As the auditor will have a better grasp of how the code functions, having clear and thorough documentation of the code may make the audit process easier and more effective.\n\n- **Internal testing and analysis**. It might be beneficial to perform some internal testing and analysis before submitting the code for an external audit to find any obvious defects or concerns. In the long term, this can save time and money because the auditor won't have to spend as much time finding and resolving these problems.\n\n- **Using open-source frameworks and libraries**. Code vulnerabilities and mistakes can be minimized by utilizing well-known, open-source libraries and frameworks. A range of automated testing tools are available that may assist in locating potential bugs and vulnerabilities in the code. Take into consideration employing these tools. These tools help speed up the auditing process and increase audit accuracy.\n\n- **Handling any problems that are found**. The auditor will deliver a report detailing any flaws or vulnerabilities found when the audit is finished. To maintain the security and operation of the token, token developers must be ready to fix these problems quickly and completely.\n\n![Audit](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbinance_smart_chain_audits%2F3.png?alt=media)\n\n## Phases the Auditing Process\n\nThe following phases are commonly included in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token audit process:\n\n**Evaluation of the Code and Contract for the Token**\n\nTo understand how the coin functions and any possible weaknesses, the auditor will first go over the contract and code. Both human and automated testing may be a part of this investigation.\n\nThe contract will be manually and automatically tested by the auditor in order to find any problems or weaknesses in the contract. Functional testing, unit testing, integration testing, and other types of testing may be included in this.\n\n**Identification and Reporting of Flaws and Vulnerabilities**\n\nThe token development team will be informed of any issues or vulnerabilities that are discovered throughout the testing process and will be documented in a report. The report will often provide thorough explanations of the problems along with suggestions for how to fix them.\n\nIn order to guarantee that the token development team is aware of the problems that have been found and how to fix them, the auditor will maintain constant communication with them. This can entail giving further instructions or information as necessary.\n\n## Post-Audit Activities\n\n**Repair and Retesting of any Issues Found**\nThe token development team will work to address any flaws or vulnerabilities discovered, and the auditor will retest the contract to ensure that the issues have been fixed. Once all issues are resolved and the contract is deemed trustworthy and safe, this procedure may continue until anything new has been detected.\n\nThe main objective of the BSC token audit process is to identify and address any issues or flaws that may compromise the token's security or functionality, as well as to ensure that the token is safe for users to use and trade.\n  \nMaking suggestions for enhancements and best practices is the second phase. The audit report must include suggestions for any enhancements or industry-recognized best practices that the token development team can use to increase the token's [security](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-smart-contract-security-audit) and functionality. These suggestions can involve making adjustments to the code, methods, or processes. For instance, the audit may point out places where the token's smart contract may be strengthened or extra security measures added. Token creators may make sure that the token is safe and useful in the long run by following these suggestions.\n\n![Post-Audit Activities](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbinance_smart_chain_audits%2F4.png?alt=media)\n\n## The Final Stage is Releasing the Audit Findings Publicly\n\nTo increase user confidence and trust, token developers should think about posting the audit report on the token's website or in a public repository. Users may see that the token has undergone a thorough audit and has been confirmed to be safe by making the audit report public. Users' trust and confidence may be increased as a result, which is crucial for any token's success.\n  \nUltimately, it's critical to keep checking on and maintaining the token's contract. Even once the audit is over, it is crucial to keep an eye out for any new vulnerabilities or problems that can develop with the token and its contract. This may entail instituting frequent security assessments, carrying out continuing maintenance and upgrades, and keeping abreast with the most recent industry standards and best practices. The token may be continuously monitored and maintained by the developers to guarantee that it is safe and useful.\n  \n## Conclusion\n\nFinally, frequent audits are essential to preserving the integrity and security of BSC tokens. These audits aid in locating and addressing any risks and vulnerabilities in the token's smart contract code, assuring the token's long-term security and functionality. Token creators may increase user trust and confidence, which is crucial for any token's success, by conducting routine audits. \n\nBefore making an investment, investors should learn about and comprehend the audit history of the token. It is wiser to **invest in a coin that has passed a comprehensive audit** and been determined to be **secure** rather than one that has not. Investors should also be aware of tokens with a spotty audit history or that haven't had any audits at all.\n\nTo preserve the security and integrity of tokens, BSC token audits are a crucial component. Token developers should make sure they conduct routine audits and adhere to the best practices and suggestions presented in the audit reports. Before making an investment, investors should learn about and comprehend a token's audit history to make sure their money is safe and reliable.\n\nIf you are looking to audit your BSC token, you can always reach out to us [here](https://www.cyberscope.io/#contact).","author":"Cyberscope Team","title":"Binance Smart Chain Audits: All You Need To Know","description":"Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network developed by Binance as an alternative to Ethereum for creating DApps and smart contracts.

A presale is a crowdfunding event that allows investors to purchase tokens before they are listed on exchanges. It is usually held by teams that are raising funds to develop their project. At the same time, investors have the opportunity to buy an altcoin that could be worth a lot more in the future. However, it is hard for them to be sure if their investments will be safe, as the projects that perform presales are in their early stages of development.\n\nIn the below article, we will describe how a Pinksale audit can be an essential tool in their decision, how crucial it is for the success of a presale and how you can get one.\n\n## What is Pinksale?\n\n[Pinksale Finance](https://www.pinksale.finance/) is a launchpad protocol that allows its users to create and launch tokens. The platform does not require coding knowledge, so anyone can generate their own token in only a few clicks. Furthermore, it offers additional features related to the token launch including LP locking, vesting options and automatic listing on exchanges such as PancakeSwap and UniSwap.\n\nEven though it originally provided services only on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), now it supports 6 more blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche networks. Pinksale is one of the most popular launchpad platforms in which users can create a presale for their token.\n\nTo keep both project owners and investors safe throughout the presale process, Pinksale offers two features: Anti-Rug and Anti-Bot systems. The Anti-Rug system gives owners the option to lock a part of their team tokens. Provided the team locks a sufficient amount of tokens for a period of time, users can be sure that the project will not be able to [rug pull](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/what-are-rug-pulls-and-how-you-can-avoid-getting-scammed) right after the presale ends. At the same time, the Anti-Bot system prevents automatic buy orders from bots, lowering the chances of investors being taken advantage of, in a potential price dump.\n\n## How Do Presales Work?\n\nA presale takes place before the official launch of an [Initial Coin Offering (ICO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico), during which the startup offers tokens to interested investors. The reason projects perform a presale is to raise funds for their operations until the official launch, when tokens will be available for everyone to buy.\n\nThe presale participants have the opportunity to buy the tokens at a lower price than if they bought them after the official launch. Of course, that benefits the investors. In case the value of the currency increases after its launch, their holdings will be worth a lot more. Although presale-stage investments can be lucrative, there are some risks to consider. If a presale campaign does not conclude as planned and the project token fails to launch officially, the investors can find themselves owning tokens of no value.\n\n![How Do Presales Work?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fhow-to-get-a-pinksale-audit%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n## Why Do You Need a Smart Contract Audit for your Presale?\n\nSmart contracts may be vulnerable to hacking, resulting in irreversible losses. Each year, billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies are lost to [cyberattacks](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/the-most-common-defi-hacks-and-how-to-protect-against-them) worldwide. Since smart contracts involve financial transactions, it is important to be error-free. Otherwise, hackers may be able to use code flaws to their advantage and steal crypto assets that can not be recovered. Therefore, project owners have to be sure that their contracts are safe and protected from malicious actions. That is why they invest in [smart contract audits](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-audit-a-smart-contract).\n\nA smart security audit is a process of checking a contract’s source code for any defects in order to ensure that it is functioning as intended. The process entails both automated and manual checks of the code for the auditors to gain a comprehensive understanding of the contract’s functionality and purpose. Furthermore, a careful examination of the code’s structure can reveal potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by external actors.\n\nAn audit report is a valuable tool for both project owners and investors. It can help the developers of the team to identify bugs or security fractures in the code that could be abused by third parties and fix them before the presale begins. Furthermore, it will provide users with all the information they need about the project in which they consider investing and warn them of possible dangers.\n\n## How Can You Get a Pinksale Audit?\n\nFollowing the need of users to trust a project before they invest, a badge section has been introduced for the presale system of Pinksale. The badges represent various security certifications the project has earned and can help users make better investment decisions.\n\nThere are 4 different badges that a project can earn for the Pinksale presale phase:\n\n**Audit Badge:** This badge means that the contract of the token has been reviewed and audited for possible vulnerabilities.\n\n**KYC Badge:** By getting the KYC badge, the team proves that one or more of its core members passed through the Know your Customer process.\n\n**SAFU Badge:** The SAFU badge indicates that the contract has been developed by an official Pinksale-approved developer. SAFU contract have various requirements that ensure the contract is safe for investors and cannot be manipulated by the project owners.\n\n**Doxx Badge: **The Doxx Badge is an extension of the KYC badge. The project team proves the identities of its members by publishing a Youtube video and an AMA (Ask me Anything) session.\n\nGetting badges for a project’s presale can increase your chances of finding more investors as they use them as criteria to evaluate their investment decisions.\n\n![A Pinksale Audit](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fhow-to-get-a-pinksale-audit%2F2.png?alt=media)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nΑ smart contract audit, ιn addition to the security insights it offers, can certainly increase the chances of a successful presale in Pinksale. The information it contains can be used by the project owners to improve the contract before the official launch. A pinksale audit is also vital for traders that want to have an unbiased review of the project before they decide to invest their funds.

Everyone wants to create their own cryptocurrency and be the next popular token that the crypto community will go crazy over. Having a smart contract for your token is only one half of the equation since you also need to ensure that the contract is safe to use by you and the investors.\n\nIn this article, we will go over the most popular kind of token, the BSC-based one, and how it is important to get a BSC token audit to check the security and functionality of the project.\n\n## What is a BSC Token\n\nBSC stands for Binance Smart Chain. It is the chain created by Binance, that also uses its native token, the BNB. A BSC token is a token created on the Binance chain since this chain is currently the most preferred one among new projects.\n\nThe Binance Smart Chain is based on Ethereum, so by being EVM-compatible, it gives developers the opportunity to create or migrate DApps, tools, and other components without experiencing any obstacles along the way.\n\nThe average transaction fees are 5 Gwei on BSC compared to 40 Gwei on Ethereum. This means it’s 8x cheaper to run a dApp on BSC.\n\nAt the time of writing, Binance smart chain is one of the world’s fastest blockchains. BSC is well known for its lightning-fast transactions, with blocks made every 3 seconds. Ethereum on the other hand takes 13 seconds to create a block.\n\nAs one of the most popular exchanges, BSC’s credibility runs across all its platforms. On top of that, the exchange vets every validator on the network and that ensures that on-chain development is both secure and reliable.\n\nBy utilizing the strengths of BSC and its native token, projects enjoy the chain’s transaction speed, low fees, and popularity. This is a great starting point for new projects since it provides a strong foundation that they can build on, for their own token.\n\n![What is an audit?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fbsc-token-audit-a-complete-guide%2F1.png?alt=media)\n\n## What is an audit\n\nSmart contracts (also known as blockchain contracts) are self-executing contracts with the terms of an agreement between buyer and seller written into lines of code. The code is stored, distributed, and replicated on a blockchain network.\n\nA [smart contract audit](https://medium.com/coinmonks/smart-contract-audits-a-complete-guide-39781ef2c972) is a full review of a smart contract’s source code that checks for vulnerabilities, optimization issues, and any kind of defects that might disrupt the contract’s intended functionality. In the end, you get a detailed report containing all findings along with recommended fixes by the engineers that audited the code.\n\nThe audit report is an important aspect of the smart contract creation process. The developer will use it as a way to check for vulnerabilities in their code, which external actors could exploit. The audit report also offers investors and users of a contract reassurance that the contract behaves as expected, which enables them to safely interact with it.\n\n## Why is it important to audit a BSC Token\n\nAs with any smart contract, BSC Tokens are subject to vulnerabilities. They can be exploited if not programmed correctly and can suffer from operational issues that can prove devastating for a project. Especially new projects that aim to take over the industry and become a reference point for future entrepreneurs.\n\nBy getting a BSC token audit you can get information on the integrity of the smart contract and find out if there are any issues that should be addressed. The report also includes recommendations on possible fixes for each finding. This includes security, performance, or business logic findings.\n\nIn recent months, there have been many cybersecurity attacks that resulted in huge sums of money being lost. In 2022 alone, more than [$3 billion were stolen according to recent reports](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-hackers-steal-3-billion-in-2022-set-to-be-biggest-year-for-digital-asset-heists-9347301.html). These could have been prevented if the contracts were properly developed and underwent a thorough audit process. There are also cases of severe contract malfunctions which, while not resulting in direct loss of funds, make investors abandon the project to protect their assets. In such cases, the project’s integrity (and trust) takes a hit, making it less likely to be a long-term success.\n\n## The process of auditing a BSC Token\n\nThere are different ways to audit a BSC Token, the most common being manual and automatic audits.\n\nMost audit providers choose the automatic auditing approach for this service. The source code of the BSC Token smart contract is analyzed by AI tools, checking it against the most common and known issues. It gives a well-rounded coverage of security vulnerabilities and performance concerns. One of the downsides of such methods is that, by being an automated process, it cannot check for well-hidden threats that could be part of the code. This could be accounted to malicious contract devs or bad programming. It is also unable to discover potential business logic concerns.\n\nEven though getting a BSC token audit with the help of an automated tool yields faster results, there are only so many things that an AI can identify. As contracts get more complex and include interactions with other contracts or wallet addresses, the value of an automated check decreases.\n\nThe manual audit on the other hand, while more time-consuming, it is considered to be the better approach. Each line of the smart contract is carefully examined to account for security vulnerabilities, performance issues as well as faults in business logic. More sophisticated manual audits include other tests as well, like unit tests. Unit tests are for checking the contract’s behaviour in different scenarios and edge cases. This can prove invaluable, especially for large-scale projects.\n\nLeading cybersecurity companies in the crypto space utilize both automatic and manual methods. This is to ensure that everything is checked and the highest possible quality of audit is delivered as an end result.\n\n## Why choose Cyberscope\n\n[Cyberscope](https://www.cyberscope.io/) is one of the leading audit companies in the crypto space. With more than 1000+ clients, its brand name has become recognizable and sought-after in the space.\n\nThey are partners with all major launchpads, that BSC token owners can use to launch their projects and get the related badges. Furthermore, their recent partnerships like the [Polygon Village program and the RadRugs](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/topics/cyberscope) are proof of how Cyberscope is the go-to cybersecurity specialist for smart contract audits. Their very own automated contract analysis tool, Cyberscan is being used in the [GeckoTerminal](https://cyberscope.medium.com/cyberscope-partners-with-geckoterminal-c98bced34375) platform, as a means to help potential investors be able to identify issues in the smart contract of projects they are researching.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA BSC token audit is the most important step for any project. By auditing your token’s contract you secure your project and provide investors with the safety that they are looking for. It is also important to consider launchpad badges.\n\nLaunchpads introduced various badges, to give investors a straightforward way to identify projects that have completed various milestones. The most common ones are the audit and the KYC badges. Investors are on the lookout for projects that have these badges, as they add to the project’s security and credibility. These can be obtained by getting each related service from verified providers of each launchpad platform. So if you are planning to use a launchpad for the presale of your BSC token, you can get both your BSC token audit and related badge, by going with a verified provider.\n\nThis article has hopefully given you a better understanding of what a BSC Token is and why it is important to invest in an audit.

In fact, recent studies have shown that 61% of enterprises claimed to have plans for integrating blockchain technology into their core business procedures. However, a major problem to the adoption of Smart Contracts is wrapped around trust and lack of regulatory frameworks. There are few, if any, applicable laws to resolve disputes arising from automated business transactions.\r\n\r\nWith the increasing importance of smart contract security, audits have become one of the most common ways to secure blockchains. In the below article, we will analyze how much time takes for an audit to be completed and what it may cost.\r\n\r\n## What is a Smart Contract Audit and Why is it Important?\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of an agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code is stored, distributed, and replicated on a blockchain network. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. The blockchain can be used to trace transactions and make them transparent for all parties involved.\r\n\r\nA [crypto security audit](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/how-to-do-a-basic-crypto-security-audit-to-your-smart-contract) focuses on a smart contract’s source code to ensure that it is functioning as intended. Auditors use automated checks and manual reviews of the code to get an overall picture of how the contract is operating and its purpose.\r\n\r\nThe audit report is important for developers as it allows them to check for vulnerabilities in their code, which could be exploited by external actors. In that way, they can ensure that the contract cannot behave in ways that it was not meant to. It can also offer the investors and users of the contract the trust and reassurance they need to interact with the contract safely.\r\n\r\n## How Many Types of Smart Contracts are There?\r\n\r\nBefore we analyze the factors that may affect the cost and the timeframe of an audit, let’s see the 3 types of contracts that exist out there:\r\n\r\n**1. Smart Legal Contract**\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are legal agreements that are executed automatically. They have the same requirements as traditional contracts, such as mutual assent, expressed by a valid offer and acceptance; adequate consideration; capacity; and legality. When set up properly, smart contracts are legally enforceable and require parties to fulfill their obligations. If a party fails to fulfill its obligations, the contract can trigger automatic legal action against the party in breach.\r\n\r\n**2. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations**\r\n\r\n[DAO](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/what-is-a-dao-and-how-to-create-one) stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization and describes a community that exists on the blockchain. This community is defined by a set of agreed-upon rules coded as smart contracts, which are enforced by all participants. Each participant’s actions are subject to these rules, and the task of enforcing them is shared among all participants in the network. The rules themselves are made up of many smart contracts that work together to keep track of activities in the DAO.\r\n\r\n![Decentralized Autonomous Organizations](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fhow-much-does-it-cost-to-audit-a-smart-contract%2F1.png?alt=media)\r\n\r\n**3. Application Logic Contracts**\r\n\r\nApplication logic contracts (ALCs) are a crucial component of multi-functional smart contracts. They enable communication across different devices and allow for the merging of IoT technology with blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nSmart contracts possess all the qualities necessary to carry out a transaction with a high degree of precision, safety, and efficiency. Because smart contracts are written in code, however, it is not easy for everyone to create one from the scratch without having a background in computer programming.\r\n\r\n## How Much Time Does it Take For an Audit to be Completed?\r\n\r\nAs you can already tell from the various types of smart contracts out there, the timeframe that an audit needs to be completed depends on many parameters. Let’s discuss the more crucial ones below:\r\n\r\n**Size**\r\n\r\nThe first and most important factor to consider for an audit is the project’s size. For instance, if you want a simple contract of ERC20 or BEP20 tokens to get audited, then you can get the audit report just within 48 hours. However, if the token is part of a Dapp, it won’t be possible to examine the code within the same timeframe. The audit process can take up to a couple of weeks to complete it. The type of contract also plays an important role in determining how quickly your company can expect its smart contract audit results. Advanced ERC20 contracts have more features than basic ones and therefore take longer to audit than basic ones.\r\n\r\n**Complexity**\r\n\r\nWhen determining the complexity of your project, consider how much time will be required for auditors to complete their work. The more functions and custom code a contract includes the more time is needed for the auditors to analyze it and run all the tests. Furthermore, the more external files it may use, the most complicated the line-by-line checks will be.\r\n\r\n![The size and the complexity of the contract are important factors](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cyberscope-90197.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fhow-much-does-it-cost-to-audit-a-smart-contract%2F2.png?alt=media)\r\n\r\n**Audit Type**\r\n\r\nThe audit types are usually divided into 2 main categories: the **Manual** and the **Automatic** Audit\r\n\r\n**Manual audits** entail an examination of lines of code for potential vulnerabilities and programming faults. They also ensure that smart contracts are adhering to their intrinsic business logic, as well as identifying edge cases and optimizing code for gas use. Unit tests are also included as part of the manual audit process of a smart contract.\r\n\r\n**Automated auditing** is a method of scanning code for defects using [audit tools](https://www.cyberscope.io/blog/free-smart-contract-audit-tools-for-investors). It guarantees that all aspects of smart contracts are covered, leaving no room for human mistakes. The automated audit may take up to one day for ERC20/BEP20 contracts.\r\n\r\n## What is The Cost of a Smart Contract Audit?\r\n\r\nCompanies that provide smart contract audit services charge from $1,000 to $15,000 on average. However, the price can be even higher in some cases. As you can understand, the expenses of development, deployment and technical support for smart contracts can become prohibitively high. Nevertheless, smart contract auditing is always recommended, as even a single bug in code may result in even higher costs, eventually.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe hope that these insights will give you a good idea of what to expect when performing a smart contract audit.
